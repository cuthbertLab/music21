`Music21` welcomes contributions such as bug reports, new features, fixes, and
documentation improvements. The
[project repository](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) is hosted at GitHub.

Information that was formerly here is now in 
[Developer Reference](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/developerReference/index.html)

Pull requests or issues created with AI or in other ways not directly authored by the
contributor must be declared with (AI) or (AI Generated) in their issue/PR titles.
If not accepted, they will generally be closed without comment unless the contributor has
a demonstrated track record of being able to fix the code in question.  Reviewers that
do not disclose AI usage will be politely reminded the first time and may be blocked
for subsequent lack of disclosure. (New in 2025: this
is a pre-emptive time savings from experiences on other Open Source projects.)

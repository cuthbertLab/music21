## Community Code of Conduct<a name="community-code-of-conduct"></a> ##

`Music21` encourages contributions, discussions, and usage from all people interested in
music and computers. This encouragement extends to all people regardless of (among other aspects)
gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, religion, appearance, veteran status,
gender identity, socioeconomic status, or nationality.

Members of the community will strive to be friendly, patient, and welcoming, especially of
viewpoints and experiences different from our own. We reject harassment and contributions
(in mail, comments, or code) that belittle individuals or groups of people.

We ask all members of the community to be mindful particularly about assumptions of the
gender of users (including using correct pronouns in comments and code). We recognize that members
sometimes make mistakes and will, in general, accept sincere regrets for such cases.
Blatant or repeated violations of the code will result in the removal of the
contributor’s participation in the community.

The maintainers of `music21` and associated sites will commit themselves to enforcing
this code of conduct. Users who notice violations, including instances of abuse,
harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behavior are requested to contact 
michael.asato.cuthbert@gmail.com.
Maintainers will respect confidentiality with regard to reports.

and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.

## License Coverage and Other/Prior Licenses ##

Music21 is Open-Source Software released under the BSD (3-clause) license.
Essentially, it's free and you can do with it what you'd like as long as you
keep the LICENSE file and copyright statement.

The license applies to all code files that are new to music21 along with
documentation. Externally provided software (including the MIT-licensed 
Lilypond/MusicXML test Suite) may have other licenses.  The encoded
musical scores in the corpus have their own copyrights and licenses. They
underlying music is believed to be in the public domain in the US, EU, and
Canada (and most of the world) and the encodings are also either public domain
or used by permission. For those needing a strict BSD-license of all parts of
the music21 system, a no-corpus version of `music21` is available also on GitHub
or from the FreeBSD repo.

(For historical reasons, music21 before v2 can also be used under the LGPL license.
Between v1 and 2, all prior contributors were 
contacted (it was a handful back then) and all agreed to relicense 
their contributions under the BSD license).

These detailed explanations of the license were moved to this README.md file in
2026 (v10) and out of LICENSE, music21/LICENSE and music21/license.txt in 
order to make the music21 license more parsable by tooling.  The move was not 
meant to imply any change in the license or your rights or obligations under it.

User's Guide, Chapter 6: Streams (II): Hierarchies, Recursion, and Flattening
=============================================================================

We ended Chapter 4 (:ref:`Streams (I) <usersGuide_04_stream1>`.) with
a :class:`~music21.stream.Stream` that was contained within another
``Stream`` object. Let's recreate that class:

.. code:: ipython3

    from music21 import *
    
    note1 = note.Note("C4")
    note1.duration.type = 'half'
    note2 = note.Note("F#4")
    note3 = note.Note("B-2")
    
    stream1 = stream.Stream()
    stream1.id = 'some notes'
    stream1.append(note1)
    stream1.append(note2)
    stream1.append(note3)
    
    biggerStream = stream.Stream()
    note2 = note.Note("D#5")
    biggerStream.insert(0, note2)
    biggerStream.append(stream1)

The only way to find out what was in the contained Stream that we
demonstrated so far was the :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show`
method using the ``('text')`` argument.

.. code:: ipython3

    biggerStream.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note D#>
    {1.0} <music21.stream.Stream some notes>
        {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
        {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
        {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


As Chapter 4 noted, there's a way to reach the inner notes such as
``F#`` via the ``biggerStream[1][2]`` format, but there's a better way
to do that in music21, and for that we need to learn about subclasses of
Streams and subclasses in general. (Skip this if you already know about
such things from other programming experience)

Classes and Subclasses
----------------------

An object, such as a note or pitch, is basically a collection of
information along with some actions that can be performed on that
information. A class is something that can make new objects of a certain
type (sometimes this is called a factory). We've seen classes such as
the ``note.Note`` class, where the lowercase ``note`` is the "module"
that the class ``Note`` lives in:

.. code:: ipython3

    #_DOCS_SHOW note
    print("<module 'music21.note' from '/Users/cuthbert/music21/note.py'>") #_DOCS_HIDE


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <module 'music21.note' from '/Users/cuthbert/music21/note.py'>


.. code:: ipython3

    print(note.Note)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <class 'music21.note.Note'>


We create an object from a class by using the class name with ``()``
after it:

.. code:: ipython3

    n = note.Note()
    n




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>



As we've seen, we can sometimes put additional information into the
``()``, such as a pitch name in the case of a ``Note``:

.. code:: ipython3

    d = note.Note('D#5')
    d




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note D#>



The variable ``d`` is now a ``Note`` object created from the ``Note``
class. It's all a bit confusing, I know. But we'll get to the point in a
second. If you want to find out more about what a ``Note`` object can
do, the best thing is to read the ``music21`` instruction manual. :-)
But for any class in Python, you can use the function ``help(Class)`` to
find out what it can do:

.. code:: ipython3

    #_DOCS_SHOW help(note.Note)

::

    Help on class Note in module music21.note:
    
    class Note(NotRest)
    |  One of the most important music21 classes, a Note
    |  stores a single note (that is, not a rest or an unpitched element)
    |  that can be represented by one or more notational units -- so
    |  for instance a C quarter-note and a D# eighth-tied-to-32nd are both
    |  a single Note object.
    |  
    |  *** ............ ***
    |  
    |  Method resolution order:
    |      Note
    |      NotRest
    |      GeneralNote
    |      music21.base.Music21Object
    |      builtins.object


Notice towards the very top there's the line ``class Note(NotRest)``.
This says that the ``Note`` class is a "subclass" of a class called
``NotRest`` which contains all the information for note-like things such
as ``Note``, ``Unpitched`` percussion, and ``Chord`` that have stems,
beams, etc. and are, well, not rests. (Chris Ariza and I spent over an
hour trying to come up with a better name for these things, but in the
end we couldn't come up with anything better than ``NotRest``, so it's
stuck).

What does it mean for ``Note`` to be a subclass of ``NotRest``? It means
that everything that ``NotRest`` can do, ``Note`` can do, and more. For
instance, ``NotRest`` has a ``.beams`` property, so so does ``Note``:

.. code:: ipython3

    nr = note.NotRest()
    n = note.Note()
    print(nr.beams, n.beams)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.beam.Beams > <music21.beam.Beams >


But ``Rest`` is not a subclass of ``NotRest`` for obvious reasons. So a
rest doesn't know anything about beams:

.. code:: ipython3

    r = note.Rest()
    r.beams


::


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-9-9c62a1bd1707> in <module>()
          1 r = note.Rest()
    ----> 2 r.beams
    

    AttributeError: 'Rest' object has no attribute 'beams'


But ``Note`` has properties that ``NotRest`` does not, such as
``.pitch``:

.. code:: ipython3

    print(nr.pitch)


::


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-10-b4fa4feba8cd> in <module>()
    ----> 1 print(nr.pitch)
    

    AttributeError: 'NotRest' object has no attribute 'pitch'


So classes and subclasses are a great way of making sure that things
that are mostly similar have many of the same properties, but that they
can have their own distinct information (``attributes``) and actions
(``methods``). Just FYI, here's how we create a subclass. We can create
a Class called ``Japan`` and then a subclass called ``Okinawa`` (my
ancestral home) which has an additional attribute.

.. code:: ipython3

    class Japan:
        food = "sushi"
        drink = "sake"
        
    class Okinawa(Japan):
        evenBetterFood = "spam_potstickers"

The ``(Japan)`` in the class definition of ``Okinawa`` means that it
inherits everything that Japan has and more:

.. code:: ipython3

    o = Okinawa() 
    print(o.food, o.drink, o.evenBetterFood)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    sushi sake spam_potstickers


But the joy of spam gyoza has not come to the mainland yet:

.. code:: ipython3

    j = Japan()
    print(j.evenBetterFood)


::


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-13-d5ba2e405b39> in <module>()
          1 j = Japan()
    ----> 2 print(j.evenBetterFood)
    

    AttributeError: 'Japan' object has no attribute 'evenBetterFood'


So this is how subclasses work in a nutshell. The first subclasses we
will be working with are the three fundamental subclasses of ``Stream``:
``Score``, ``Part``, and ``Measure``.

Accessing Scores, Parts, Measures, and Notes
--------------------------------------------

Streams provide a way to structure and position music21 objects both
hierarchically and temporally. A Stream, or a Stream subclass such as
:class:`~music21.stream.Measure`, can be placed within another Stream.

A common arrangement of nested Streams is a
:class:`~music21.stream.Score` Stream containing one or more
:class:`~music21.stream.Part` Streams, each Part Stream in turn
containing one or more :class:`~music21.stream.Measure` Streams.

Such an arrangement of Stream objects is the common way musical scores
are represented in music21. For example, importing a four-part chorale
by J. S. Bach will provide a Score object with four Part Streams, each
Part containing multiple Measure objects. Music21 comes with a
:ref:`moduleCorpus` module that provides access to a large collection
of scores, including all the Bach chorales. We can parse the score from
the corpus with the :func:`~music21.corpus.parse` function, which we
will discuss more in a bit.

.. code:: ipython3

    sBach = corpus.parse('bach/bwv57.8')

| We can access and examine elements at each level of this Score by
  using standard Python syntax for lists within lists. Thus, we can see
  the length of each component: first the Score which has six elements:
  a :class:`~music21.metadata.Metadata` object, a
  :class:`~music21.layout.StaffGroup` object, and four
  :class:`~music21.stream.Part` objects. Then we find the length of
  first Part at index one which indicates 19 objects (18 of them are
  measures).

| Then within that part we find an object (a Measure) at index 1. All of
  these subprograms can be accessed from looking within the same score
  object ``sBach``.

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    6



.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach[1])




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    19



.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach[1][1])




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    6



But how did we know that index [1] would be a Part and index [1][1]
would be a measure? As writers of the tutorial, we know this piece well
enough to know that. But as we noted above, more than just Measures
might be stored in a Part object (such as
:class:`~music21.instrument.Instrument` objects), and more than just
Note and Rest objects might be stored in a Measure (such as
:class:`~music21.meter.TimeSignature` and
:class:`~music21.key.KeySignature` objects). Therefore, it's much
safer to filter Stream and Stream subclasses by the class we seek.

To repeat the count and select specific classes, we can use the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementsByClass` method that we
discussed in :ref:`Chapter 4 <usersGuide_04_stream1>`.

Notice how the counts deviate from the examples above.

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.getElementsByClass(stream.Part))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4



.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.getElementsByClass(stream.Part)[0].getElementsByClass(stream.Measure))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    18



.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.getElementsByClass(stream.Part)[0].getElementsByClass(
            stream.Measure)[1].getElementsByClass(note.Note))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    3



Recall from :ref:`Chapter 4 <usersGuide_04_stream1>` that the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementsByClass` method can also take
a string representation of the last section of the class name. Thus we
could've rewritten the first call above as:

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.getElementsByClass('Part'))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4



This way of doing things is a bit faster to code, but a little less
safe. Suppose, for instance there were objects of type
``stream.Measure`` and ``tape.Measure``; the latter way of writing the
code would get both of them. (But this ambiguity is rare enough that
it's safe enough to use the strings in most code.)

When we introduced ``.getElementsByClass()`` we also introduced the
convenience properties ``.notes`` and ``.notesAndRests``. There is a
convenience property for getting parts out as well:

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.parts)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4



You might think that there should be a convenience property
``.measures`` to get all the measures. But the problem with that is that
measure numbers would be quite different from index numbers. For
instance, most pieces (that don't have pickup measures) begin with
measure 1, not zero. Sometimes there are measure discontinuities within
a piece (e.g., some people number first and second endings with the same
measure number). For that reason, gathering Measures is best
accomplished not with ``getElementsByClass(stream.Measure)`` but instead
with either the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.measures` method
(returning a Stream of Parts or Measures) or the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.measure` method (returning a single
Measure).

These are methods, not properties, so they use the ``()`` call. Let's
look at how we might use them:

.. code:: ipython3

    alto = sBach.parts[1] # parts count from zero, so soprano is 0 and alto is 1
    excerpt = alto.measures(1, 4)
    excerpt.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_06_stream2_47_0.png
   :width: 748px
   :height: 155px


.. code:: ipython3

    measure2 = alto.measure(2) # measure not measure_s_
    measure2.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_06_stream2_48_0.png
   :width: 460px
   :height: 155px


What is great about ``.measure()`` and ``.measures()`` is that they can
work on a whole score and not just a single part. Sometimes
computational musicologists and programmers call a collection of
measures across parts a "measureStack". So let's get the measure stack
consisting of measure numbers 2 and 3 across all parts:

.. code:: ipython3

    measureStack = sBach.measures(2, 3)
    measureStack.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_06_stream2_50_0.png
   :width: 748px
   :height: 369px


Recursion in Streams
--------------------

``Streams`` are hierarchical objects where the contained elements can
themselves be Streams. In order to get at each lower layer of the
stream, a generator method on every stream called
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.recurse` will visit every element in the
stream, starting from the beginning, and if any of the subelements are
also Streams, they will visit every element in that Stream.

Let's create a simpler Stream to visualize what ``.recurse()`` does.

.. code:: ipython3

    s = stream.Score(id='mainScore')
    p0 = stream.Part(id='part0')
    p1 = stream.Part(id='part1')
    
    m01 = stream.Measure(number=1)
    m01.append(note.Note('C', type="whole"))
    m02 = stream.Measure(number=2)
    m02.append(note.Note('D', type="whole"))
    p0.append([m01, m02])
    
    m11 = stream.Measure(number=1)
    m11.append(note.Note('E', type="whole"))
    m12 = stream.Measure(number=2)
    m12.append(note.Note('F', type="whole"))
    p1.append([m11, m12])
    
    s.insert(0, p0)
    s.insert(0, p1)
    s.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.stream.Part part0>
        {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
        {4.0} <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note D>
    {0.0} <music21.stream.Part part1>
        {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note E>
        {4.0} <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note F>


.. code:: ipython3

    s.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_06_stream2_54_0.png
   :width: 177px
   :height: 121px


Calling ``.recurse()`` on its own isn't very useful.

.. code:: ipython3

    recurseScore = s.recurse()
    recurseScore




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.stream.iterator.RecursiveIterator for Score:mainScore @:0>



Where it becomes useful is in a ``for`` loop:

.. code:: ipython3

    for el in s.recurse():
        print(el.offset, el, el.activeSite)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0 <music21.stream.Score mainScore> None
    0.0 <music21.stream.Part part0> <music21.stream.Score mainScore>
    0.0 <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0> <music21.stream.Part part0>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note C> <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
    4.0 <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0> <music21.stream.Part part0>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note D> <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>
    0.0 <music21.stream.Part part1> <music21.stream.Score mainScore>
    0.0 <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0> <music21.stream.Part part1>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note E> <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
    4.0 <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0> <music21.stream.Part part1>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note F> <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>


This example also introduces the concept of ``.activeSite``, which for
now can be thought of as the Stream that the element lives in; though
we'll find that ``Notes`` and other elements can be in multiple Streams
simultaneously, and this is just the one that they are most recently
associated with.

There are a lot of things that we can do with ``.recurse()``, but let's
just introduce one more thing for now. Most "filtering" mechanisms, such
as ``.notes`` can also be applied between the ``()`` of ``recurse()``
and the ``:`` at the end:

.. code:: ipython3

    for el in s.recurse().notes:
        print(el.offset, el, el.activeSite)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0 <music21.note.Note C> <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note D> <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note E> <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note F> <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>


.. note::

   `.recurse()` is a generator as of v2.0.10. Thus, it can only be used in `for` loops and other things that
   iterate over each member of a list.  To treat the results of `.recurse()` as a list, you need to wrap it
   
   >>> listRecurse = list(sBach.recurse())

In general, ``.recurse()`` is the best way to work through all the
elements of a Stream, but there is another way that can be handy in some
situations, and that is called ``.flat``.

Flattening a Stream
-------------------

While nested Streams offer expressive flexibility, it is often useful to
be able to flatten all Stream and Stream subclasses into a single Stream
containing only the elements that are not Stream subclasses. The
:attr:``~music21.stream.Stream.flat`` property provides immediate access
to such a flat representation of a Stream. For example, doing a similar
count of components, such as that show above, we see that we cannot get
to all of the Note objects of a complete Score until we flatten its Part
and Measure objects by accessing the ``flat`` attribute. Note that for
historical reasons, ``.flat`` is a property, so you do not use ``()``
around it.

Let's look at what ``.flat`` does to the example score we created.

.. code:: ipython3

    for el in s.flat:
        print(el.offset, el, el.activeSite)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0 <music21.note.Note C> <music21.stream.Score mainScore_flat>
    0.0 <music21.note.Note E> <music21.stream.Score mainScore_flat>
    4.0 <music21.note.Note D> <music21.stream.Score mainScore_flat>
    4.0 <music21.note.Note F> <music21.stream.Score mainScore_flat>


A new, temporary ``Stream`` with ``id`` of "mainScore\_flat" has been
created, and all of the ``Note`` objects are in there. We didn't filter
out non-Notes: ``.flat`` automatically removes all ``Stream`` objects
and in this case there's nothing else but Notes in there.

All the ``Note`` objects are now in the new temporary ``mainScore_flat``
object, and their offsets are no longer all ``0.0``, but are instead
measured from the start of the score being flattened. So the whole notes
in measure 2 are given offset ``4.0``

Compare what ``.flat`` lets you do when looking at a larger score.

There are no Notes in the sBach stream...

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.getElementsByClass(note.Note))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0



...they are all inside Measures inside Parts inside the stream. (in a
more complex score, they may be in Voices inside Measures inside Parts,
etc.). But they are all inside the flat version of the Stream:

.. code:: ipython3

    len(sBach.flat.getElementsByClass(note.Note))




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    213



Element offsets are always relative to the Stream that contains them.
For example, a Measure, when placed in a Stream, might have an offset of
16. This offset describes the position of the Measure in the Stream.
Components of this Measure, such as Notes, have offset values relative
only to their container, the Measure. The first Note of this Measure,
then, has an offset of 0. In the following example we find that the
offset of measure eight (using the
:meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.getOffsetBySite` method) is 21; the
offset of the second Note in this Measure (index 1), however, is 1.

.. code:: ipython3

    m = sBach.parts[0].getElementsByClass('Measure')[7]
    m.getOffsetBySite(sBach.parts[0])




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    21.0



.. code:: ipython3

    n = sBach.parts[0].measure(8).notes[1]
    n




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B->



.. code:: ipython3

    n.getOffsetBySite(m)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    1.0



Flattening a structure of nested Streams will set new, shifted offsets
for each of the elements on the Stream, reflecting their appropriate
position in the context of the Stream from which the ``flat`` property
was accessed. For example, if a flat version of the first part of the
Bach chorale is obtained, the note defined above has the appropriate
offset of 22 (the Measure offset of 21 plus the Note offset within this
Measure of 1).

.. code:: ipython3

    pFlat = sBach.parts[0].flat
    indexN = pFlat.index(n)
    pFlat[indexN]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B->



.. code:: ipython3

    pFlat[indexN].offset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    22.0



As an aside, it is important to recognize that the offset of the Note
has not been edited; instead, a Note, as all Music21Objects, can store
multiple pairs of sites and offsets. Music21Objects retain an offset
relative to all Stream or Stream subclasses they are contained within,
even if just in passing.

There's still a lot more to learn about ``Streams``, but we can do that
later. For now, let's move on to
:ref:`Chapter 7: Chords <usersGuide_07_chords>`.

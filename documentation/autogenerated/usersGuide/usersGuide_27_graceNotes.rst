User's Guide, Chapter 27: Grace Notes
=====================================

Grace notes present particular problems for almost all computer
representations of scores. In one way of theorizing them, they take up
no time whatsoever -- you can take a full measure of 4/4 and add two
hundred grace notes and the measure is still not over full. On the other
hand, they need to take up some time, otherwise how would we hear them?

So we have something that takes up no time, but takes up time, at the
same time. Let's look more closely at them. Along the way we'll look at
appogiature, which present some issues that are similar and some that
are different.

Basic Graces
------------

We'll begin by creating a 4/4 measure of four quarter notes:

.. code:: ipython3

    from music21 import *
    
    m = stream.Measure()
    m.append(meter.TimeSignature('4/4'))
    m.repeatAppend(note.Note('C5'), 4)
    m.show()

Now let's insert a D-grace note just before the third quarter note.
First we create a normal note (usually an eighth note) and then we
create a new grace note with the ``getGrace`` method.

.. code:: ipython3

    d = note.Note('D5', type='eighth')
    dGrace = d.getGrace()
    m.insert(2.0, dGrace)
    m.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_27_graceNotes_4_0.png
   :width: 230px
   :height: 49px


If we look at ``dGrace`` at first it appears to be just a normal Note:

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note D>



But its ``duration`` is a subclass called ``GraceDuration``.
Importantly, it is an "unlinked" duration, meaning that the ``type``
(e.g. "eighth") of the duration does not say how long it lasts.

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace.duration




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.duration.GraceDuration unlinked type:zero quarterLength:0.0>



.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace.duration.linked




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    False



There is one ``DurationTuple`` in the ``.components`` of the
GraceDuration object, and it is an eighth note of length 0.

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace.duration.components




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    (DurationTuple(type='eighth', dots=0, quarterLength=0.0),)



A GraceDuration has the boolean attribute ``.slash`` which says whether
or not it receives a slash. By default this is True.

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace.duration.slash




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True



Within a ``Stream`` grace notes sort before elements of the same class
that have the same priority and offset. Internally, this is done by
setting ``isNotGrace`` to 0 in the sort tuple. (normally it is 1).

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace.sortTuple()




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    SortTuple(atEnd=0, offset=2.0, priority=0, classSortOrder=20, isNotGrace=0, insertIndex=146)



Normally grace notes are slurred to the following note, so let's add a
slur there.

.. code:: ipython3

    thirdNote = m.notes[-2]
    sl = spanner.Slur(dGrace, thirdNote)
    m.insert(0, sl)
    m.show()

Multiple Grace Notes
--------------------

Multiple grace notes are normally beamed together and generally written
as sixteenth or thirty-second notes. We'll add two graces to the last C
in the measure:

.. code:: ipython3

    eGrace = note.Note('E5', type='16th').getGrace()
    dGrace2 = note.Note('D5', type='16th').getGrace()
    eGrace.beams.fill(2, 'start')
    dGrace2.beams.fill(2, 'stop')
    m.insert(3.0, eGrace)
    m.insert(3.0, dGrace2)
    m.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_27_graceNotes_20_0.png
   :width: 264px
   :height: 54px


Notice that the grace notes are ordered according to the principle,
"first inserted = left-most, last inserted = right-most." If you know
every note to be inserted in advance, then there's no problem getting
the order right. But suppose you need to change it later? In this case,
change the priority of the grace notes:

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace2.priority = -1
    m.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_27_graceNotes_22_0.png
   :width: 264px
   :height: 54px


Note that the default priority of all objects is 0, so that by giving a
priority higher than 1, the grace notes can be made to follow the main
note:

.. code:: ipython3

    dGrace2.priority = 1
    eGrace.priority = 2
    m.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_27_graceNotes_24_0.png
   :width: 260px
   :height: 54px


This is useful for cases such as putting a "Nachschlag" or
"Nachschlagen" after a trill:

.. code:: ipython3

    p = stream.Part()
    m1 = stream.Measure()
    n2 = note.Note('F#5', type='whole')
    nach1 = note.Note('E5', type='16th').getGrace()
    nach2 = note.Note('F#5', type='16th').getGrace()
    nach1.priority = 1
    nach2.priority = 2
    
    trMark = expressions.Trill()
    n2.expressions.append(trMark)
    
    m1.insert(0, n2)
    m1.insert(0, nach1)
    m1.insert(0, nach2)
    
    p.append(m1)
    
    m2 = stream.Measure()
    nResolve = note.Note('G5', type='whole')
    m2.append(nResolve)
    p.append(m2)
    
    # nResolve is necessary because 
    # MuseScore has a bug with spanners that end with grace notes.
    nachSlur = spanner.Slur([nach1, nach2, nResolve])
    p.insert(0, nachSlur)
    
    # beams are also created automagically on show
    p.show()

Stealing time
-------------

``.stealTimePrevious`` and ``.stealTimeFollowing`` are values from 0 to
1 that show what fraction of the previous or following note's durations
should be allocated to make room for this grace note.

MIDI output does not yet support playing back grace notes.

That's enough on grace notes for now. Let's move to finding things with
something to say:

    "`Music21` contains a powerful context and hierarchy system that lets users find analytical information in a single place that actually requires looking at many pieces of information scattered throughout a score. Take for instance, a fragment of code that we use a lot such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> n.beat\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's great when it works, but then there are times when it doesn't and it's just frustrating.  Avoiding those times is what this chapter is about.  And to do so, we'll need to start asking some \"how\" questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a note know what beat it is on? It might help to think about when we read a printed score, how do we know what beat a note is on?  We have to look at the note, then look up the score to find the most recent time signature, then find the note again and look at the measure it is in, count everything preceeding it in the measure, and then calculate the beat.  At least three different musical objects need to be consulted: the note itself, the surrounding measure, and the time signature that provides an interpretation of how note durations translate to beats.  `Music21` needs to do the same search, and it does all that just on a little call to the `.beat` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*In the early days of `music21`, I did not know about the convention that properties should be fast and easily computable so that the user does not even realize it is something more complex than an attribute lookup.  The property `.beat` is none of the above.  If I were starting over, it would be a method, `.beat()`, but it is too late to change now.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how this lookup works, we will need to understand better how `Sites` and `Contexts` work. Advanced users and beginners alike (and occasionally even the `music21` developers) are frequently confused by `music21`'s context and hierarchy system. When it works, it works great, it's just magic.  But, when it doesn't, it appears to be a random bug, and it is probably the most common type of bug mention on the `music21` GitHub tracker that gets \"not a bug\" as a response. Magic is fickle that way.\n",

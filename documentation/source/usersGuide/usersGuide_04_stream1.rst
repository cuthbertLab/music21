User's Guide, Chapter 4: Lists, Streams (I) and Output
======================================================

In the last two chapters, I introduced the concept of
:class:`~music21.note.Note` objects which are made up of
:class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch` and
:class:`~music21.duration.Duration` objects, and we even displayed a
Note on a staff and played it via MIDI. But unless you're challenging
Cage and Webern for the status of least musical material, you will
probably want to analyze, manipulate, or create more than one Note.

Python has ways of working with multiple objects and ``music21`` extends
those ways to be more musical. Let's look at how Python does it first
and then see how ``music21`` extends these ways. (If you've been
programming for a bit, or especially if you have Python experience, skip
to the section on Streams below after creating the objects ``note1``,
``note2`` and ``note3`` described below).

Say you have two notes, a C and an F# in the middle of the treble staff.
(If the concept of working with a tritone bothers you, go ahead and make
the second note a G; we won't mind; we'll just call you Pope Gregory
from now on). Lets create those notes:

Working with multiple objects via Lists
---------------------------------------

.. code:: ipython3

    from music21 import *
    note1 = note.Note("C4")
    note2 = note.Note("F#4")

Let's make the first note a half note by modifying its duration (by
default all ``Note`` objects are quarter notes):

.. code:: ipython3

    note1.duration.type = 'half'
    note1.duration.quarterLength




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2.0



.. code:: ipython3

    note2.duration.quarterLength




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    1.0



To print the ``step`` (that is, the name without any octave or
accidental information) of each of these notes, you could do something
like this:

.. code:: ipython3

    print(note1.step)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    C


.. code:: ipython3

    print(note2.step)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    F


But suppose you had thirty notes? Then it'd be a pain to type
"``print(noteX.step)``" thirty times. Fortunately, there's a solution:
we can put each of the note objects into a ``List`` which is a built in
Python object that stores multiple other objects (like Notes or Chords,
or even things like numbers). To create a list in Python, put square
brackets (``[]``) around the things that you want to put in the list,
separated by commas. Let's create a list called ``noteList`` that
contains note1 and note2:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList = [note1, note2]

We can check that ``noteList`` contains our Notes by printing it:

.. code:: ipython3

    print(noteList)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    [<music21.note.Note C>, <music21.note.Note F#>]


The list is represented by the square brackets around the end with the
comma in between them, just like how they were created originally. The
act of creation is mirrored in the representation. That's nice. Medieval
philosophers would approve.

Now we can write a two-line program that will print the step of each
note in noteList. Most modern languages have a way of doing some action
for each member ("element") in a list (also called an "array" or
sometimes "row"). In Python this is the "for" command. When you type
these lines, make sure to type the spaces at the start of the second
line. (When you're done typing ``print(thisNote.step)``, you'll probably
have to hit enter twice to see the results.)

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in noteList:
        print(thisNote.step)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    C
    F


What's happening here? What ``for thisNote in noteList:`` says is that
Python should take each note in noteList in order and temporarily call
that note "``thisNote``" (you could have it called anything you want;
``myNote``, ``n``, ``currentNote`` are all good names, but ``note`` is
not because ``note`` is the name of a module). Then the ":" at the end
of the line indicates that everything that happens for a bit will apply
to every ``Note`` in noteList one at a time. How does Python know when
"a bit" is over? Simple: every line that is a part of the loop needs to
be indented by putting in some spaces. (I usually use four spaces or hit
tab. Some people use two spaces. Just be consistent.)

Loops don't save much time here, but imagine if noteList had dozens or
hundreds of Notes in it? Then the ability to do something to each object
becomes more and more important.

Let's add another note to noteList. First let's create another note, a
low B-flat:

.. code:: ipython3

    note3 = note.Note("B-2")

Then we'll append that note to the end of noteList:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList.append(note3)

Lists can be manipulated or changed. They are called "mutable" objects
(we'll learn about immutable objects later). Streams, as we will see,
can be manipulated the same way through ``.append()``.

We can see that the length of noteList is now 3 using the ``len()``
function:

.. code:: ipython3

    len(noteList)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    3



And if we write our looping function again, we will get a third note:

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in noteList:
        print(thisNote.step)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    C
    F
    B


We can find out what the first note of noteList is by writing:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList[0]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>



Notice that in a list, the first element is ``[0]``, not ``[1]``. There
are all sorts of historical reasons why computers start counting lists
with zero rather than one--some good, some obsolete--but we need to live
with this if we're going to get any work done. Think of it like how
floors are numbered in European buildings compared to American
buildings. If we go forward one note, to the second note, we write:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList[1]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note F#>



We can also ask ``noteList`` where is ``note2`` within it, using the
``index()`` method:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList.index(note2)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    1



If we want to get the last element of a list, we can write:

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList[-1]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B->



Which is how basements are numbered in Europe as well. This is the same
element as ``noteList[2]`` (our third Note), as we can have Python
prove:\`

.. code:: ipython3

    noteList[-1] is noteList[2]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True



Lists will become important tools in your programming, but they don't
know anything about music. To get some intelligence into our music we'll
need to know about a ``music21`` object similar to lists, called a
:class:`~music21.stream.Stream`.

Introduction to Streams
-----------------------

The :class:`~music21.stream.Stream` object and its subclasses (Score,
Part, Measure) are the fundamental containers for music21 objects such
as :class:`~music21.note.Note`, :class:`~music21.chord.Chord`,
:class:`~music21.clef.Clef`, :class:`~music21.meter.TimeSignature`
objects.

A container is like a Python list (or an array in some languages).

Objects stored in a Stream are generally spaced in time; each stored
object has an offset usually representing how many quarter notes it lies
from the beginning of the Stream. For instance in a 4/4 measure of two
half notes, the first note will be at offset 0.0, and the second at
offset 2.0.

Streams, further, can store other Streams, permitting a wide variety of
nested, ordered, and timed structures. These stored streams also have
offsets. So if we put two 4/4 Measure objects (subclasses of Stream)
into a Part (also a type of Stream), then the first measure will be at
offset 0.0 and the second measure will be at offset 4.0.

Commonly used subclasses of Streams include the
:class:`~music21.stream.Score`, :class:`~music21.stream.Part`, and
:class:`~music21.stream.Measure`. It is important to grasp that any
time we want to collect and contain a group of music21 objects, we put
them into a Stream. Streams can also be used for less conventional
organizational structures. We frequently will build and pass around
short-lived, temporary Streams, since doing this opens up a wide variety
of tools for extracting, processing, and manipulating objects on the
Stream. For instance, if you are looking at only notes on beat 2 of any
measure, you'll probably want to put them into a Stream as well.

A critical feature of music21's design that distinguishes it from other
music analysis frameworks is that one music21 object can be
simultaneously stored (or, more accurately, referenced) in more than one
Stream. For examples, we might have numerous
:class:`~music21.stream.Measure` Streams contained in a
:class:`~music21.stream.Part` Stream. If we extract a region of this
Part (using the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.measures` method), we
get a new Stream containing the specified Measures and the contained
notes. We have not actually created new notes within these extracted
measures; the output Stream simply has references to the same objects.
Changes made to Notes in this output Stream will be simultaneously
reflected in Notes in the source Part. There is one limitation though:
the same object should not appear twice in one hierarchical structure of
Streams. For instance, you should not put a note object in both measure
3 and measure 5 of the same piece -- it can appear in measure 3 of one
piece and measure 5 of another piece. (For instance, if you wanted to
track a particular note's context in an original version of a score and
an arrangement). Most users will never need to worry about these
details: just know that this feature lets music21 do some things that no
other software package can do.

Creating simple Streams
-----------------------

Objects stored in Streams are called elements and must be some type of
Music21Object (don’t worry, almost everything in music21 is a
Music21Object, such as Note, Chord, TimeSignature, etc.).

(If you want to put an object that's not a Music21Object in a Stream,
put it in an :class:`~music21.base.ElementWrapper`.)

Streams are similar to Python lists in that they hold individual
elements in order. They're different in that they can only hold
``music21`` objects such as Notes or :class:`~music21.clef.Clef`
objects. But they're a lot smarter and more powerful.

To create a Stream you'll need to type ``stream.Stream()`` and assign it
to a variable using the equal sign. Let's call our Stream ``stream1``:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1 = stream.Stream()

| Notice that just like how the (capital) ``Note`` object lives in a
  module called (lowercase) ``note``, the (capital) ``Stream`` object
  lives in a module called (lowercase) ``stream``. Variable names, like
  ``stream1`` can be either uppercase or lowercase, but I tend to use
  lowercase variable names (or camelCase like we did with ``noteList``).

| The most common use of Streams is as places to store Notes. So let's
  do just that: we can add the three ``Note`` objects we created above
  by using the ``append`` method of ``Stream``:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.append(note1)
    stream1.append(note2)
    stream1.append(note3)

Of course, this would be a pain to type for hundreds of ``Notes``, so we
could also use the Stream method
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.repeatAppend` to add a number of
independent, unique copies of the same Note. This creates independent
copies (using Python's ``copy.deepcopy`` function) of the supplied
object, not references.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream2 = stream.Stream()
    n3 = note.Note('D#5') # octave values can be included in creation arguments
    stream2.repeatAppend(n3, 4)
    stream2.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_04_stream1_48_0.png
   :width: 223px
   :height: 49px


But let's worry about that later. Going back to our first stream, we can
see that it has three notes using the same ``len()`` function that we
used before:

.. code:: ipython3

    len(stream1)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    3



Alternatively, we can use the :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show`
method called as ``show('text')`` to see what is in the Stream and what
its offset is (here 0.0, since we put it at the end of an empty stream).

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
    {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
    {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


If you’ve setup your environment properly, then calling show with the
``musicxml`` argument should open up Finale Reader, or Sibelius, or
MuseScore or some music notation software and display the notes below.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_04_stream1_54_0.png
   :width: 237px
   :height: 62px


Accessing Streams
-----------------

We can also dive deeper into streams. Let's get the ``step`` of each
``Note`` using the ``for thisNote in ...:`` command. But now we'll use
``stream1`` instead of ``noteList``:

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1:
        print(thisNote.step)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    C
    F
    B


And we can get the first and the last ``Note`` in a ``Stream`` by using
the [X] form, just like other Python list-like objects:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1[0]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>



.. code:: ipython3

    stream1[-1].nameWithOctave




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'B-2'



While full list-like functionality of the Stream isn't there, some
additional methods familiar to users of Python lists are also available.
The Stream :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.index` method can be used to
get the first-encountered index of a supplied object.

.. code:: ipython3

    note3Index = stream1.index(note3)
    note3Index




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2



Given an index, an element from the Stream can be removed with the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.pop` method.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.pop(note3Index)
    stream1.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_04_stream1_64_0.png
   :width: 194px
   :height: 49px


Since we removed ``note3`` from ``stream1`` with the the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.pop` method, let's add ``note3`` back
into ``stream1`` so that we can continue with the examples below using
``stream1`` as we originally created it.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.append(note3)
    stream1.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_04_stream1_66_0.png
   :width: 237px
   :height: 62px


Separating out elements by class with ``.getElementsByClass()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also gather elements based on the class (object type) of the
element, by offset range, or by specific identifiers attached to the
element. Gathering elements from a Stream based on the class of the
element provides a way to filter the Stream for desired types of
objects. The :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementsByClass` method
iterates over a Stream of elements that are instances or subclasses of
the provided classes. The example below gathers all
:class:`~music21.note.Note` objects and then all
:class:`~music21.note.Rest` objects. The easiest way to do this is to
use ``for`` loops with ``.getElementsByClass()``:

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1.getElementsByClass(note.Note):
        print(thisNote, thisNote.offset)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C> 0.0
    <music21.note.Note F#> 2.0
    <music21.note.Note B-> 3.0


If you want instead of passing the class ``note.Note`` you could instead
pass the string ``"Note"``.

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1.getElementsByClass("Note"):
        print(thisNote, thisNote.offset)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C> 0.0
    <music21.note.Note F#> 2.0
    <music21.note.Note B-> 3.0


It is also possible to pass in a list of classes or strings of class
names to ``.getElementsByClass()`` which will return anything that
matches any of the classes. Notice the ``[]`` marks in the next call,
indicating that we are creating a list to pass to
``.getElementsByClass()``:

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1.getElementsByClass(["Note", "Rest"]):
        print(thisNote, thisNote.offset)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C> 0.0
    <music21.note.Note F#> 2.0
    <music21.note.Note B-> 3.0


Since there are no ``note.Rest`` objects, it's the same as above. Oh
well...

``music21`` has a couple of shortcuts that are equivalent to
``.getElementsByClass``. For instance ``.notes`` is equivalent to
``.getElementsByClass(["Note", "Chord"])`` (we'll get to chords soon):

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1.notes:
        print(thisNote)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>
    <music21.note.Note F#>
    <music21.note.Note B->


And ``.notesAndRests`` is equivalent to
``.getElementsByClass(['Note', 'Chord', 'Rest'])``.

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1.notesAndRests:
        print(thisNote)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>
    <music21.note.Note F#>
    <music21.note.Note B->


Finally, there's something slightly different. ``.pitches`` begins with
a call to ``.notes``, but then returns a list of all the pitches from
every ``Note`` or ``Chord`` in the Stream:

.. code:: ipython3

    listOut = stream1.pitches
    listOut




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    [<music21.pitch.Pitch C4>,
     <music21.pitch.Pitch F#4>,
     <music21.pitch.Pitch B-2>]



The result of a ``.getElementsByClass`` are not technically streams, but
you can still call ``.show()`` on it:

.. code:: ipython3

    sOut = stream1.getElementsByClass(note.Note)
    sOut.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
    {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
    {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


But if you want to be absolutely sure, put the expression ``.stream()``
after it:

.. code:: ipython3

    sOut = stream1.getElementsByClass(note.Note).stream() # <-- different
    sOut.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
    {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
    {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


Separating out elements by offset with ``.getElementsByOffset()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementsByOffset` method returns
a Stream of all elements that fall either at a single offset or within a
range of two offsets provided as an argument. In both cases a Stream is
returned.

.. code:: ipython3

    sOut = stream1.getElementsByOffset(3)
    len(sOut)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    1



.. code:: ipython3

    sOut[0]




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B->



Like with ``.getElementsByClass()`` if you want a ``Stream`` from
``.getElementsByOffset()``, add ``.stream()`` to the end of it.

.. code:: ipython3

    sOut = stream1.getElementsByOffset(2, 3).stream()
    sOut.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
    {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


We will do more with ``.getElementsByOffset()`` later when we also talk
about :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementAtOrBefore` and
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.getElementAfterElement`

More Stream Features
--------------------

Okay, so far we've seen that ``Streams`` can do the same things as
lists, but can they do more? Let's call the analyze method on stream to
get the ambitus (that is, the range from the lowest note to the highest
note) of the ``Notes`` in the ``Stream``:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.analyze('ambitus')




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.interval.Interval A12>



Let's take a second to check this. Our lowest note is ``note3`` (B-flat
in octave 2) and our highest note is ``note2`` (F-sharp in octave 4).
From B-flat to the F-sharp above it, is an augmented fifth. An augmented
fifth plus an octave is an augmented twelfth. So we're doing well so
far. (We'll get to other things we can analyze in chapter 18 and we'll
see what an :class:`~music21.interval.Interval` object can do in
chapter 15).

As we mentioned earlier, when placed in a Stream, Notes and other
elements also have an offset (stored in .offset) that describes their
position from the beginning of the stream. These offset values are also
given in quarter-lengths (QLs).

Once a Note is in a Stream, we can ask for the ``offset`` of the
``Notes`` (or anything else) in it. The ``offset`` is the position of a
Note relative to the start of the ``Stream`` measured in quarter notes.
So note1's offset will be 0.0, since it's at the start of the Stream:

.. code:: ipython3

    note1.offset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0



``note2``'s offset will be 2.0, since ``note1`` is a half note, worth
two quarter notes:

.. code:: ipython3

    note2.offset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2.0



And ``note3``, which follows the quarter note ``note2`` will be at
offset 3.0:

.. code:: ipython3

    note3.offset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    3.0



(If we made ``note2`` an eighth note, then ``note3``'s offset would be
the floating point [decimal] value 2.5. But we didn't.) So now when
we're looping we can see the offset of each note. Let's print the note's
offset followed by its name by putting .offset and .name in the same
line, separated by a comma:

.. code:: ipython3

    for thisNote in stream1:
        print(thisNote.offset, thisNote.name)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0 C
    2.0 F#
    3.0 B-


(**Digression**: It's probably not too early to learn that a safer form
of ``.offset`` is ``.getOffsetBySite(stream1)``:

.. code:: ipython3

    note2.offset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2.0



.. code:: ipython3

    note2.getOffsetBySite(stream1)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2.0



What's the difference? Remember how I said that ``.offset`` refers to
the number of quarter notes that the ``Note`` is from the front of a
``Stream``? Well, eventually you may put the same ``Note`` in different
places in multiple ``Streams``, so the ``.getOffsetBySite(X)`` command
is a safer way that specifies exactly which Stream we are talking about.
End of digression...)

As a final note about offsets, the
:attr:``~music21.stream.Stream.lowestOffset`` property returns the
minimum of all offsets for all elements on the Stream.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.lowestOffset




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    0.0



So, what else can we do with Streams? Like ``Note`` objects, we can
``show()`` them in a couple of different ways. Let's hear these three
Notes as a MIDI file:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.show('midi')



.. raw:: html

    
                    <div id='midiPlayerDiv845'></div>
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://artusi.xyz/music21j/css/m21.css" 
                        type="text/css" />
                    <script>
                    require.config({
                        paths: {'music21': 'http://artusi.xyz/music21j/src/music21'} 
                    }); 
                    require(['music21'], function() { 
                                   mp = new music21.miditools.MidiPlayer();
                                   mp.addPlayer('#midiPlayerDiv845'); 
                                   mp.base64Load('data:audio/midi;base64,TVRoZAAAAAYAAQABBABNVHJrAAAAKQD/AwAA4ABAiACQPFqQAIA8AACQQlqIAIBCAACQLlqIAIAuAIgA/y8A'); 
                            });
                    </script>


Or let's see them as a score:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.show()



.. image:: usersGuide_04_stream1_108_0.png
   :width: 237px
   :height: 62px


You might ask why is the piece in common-time (4/4)? This is just the
default for new pieces, which is in the ``defaults`` module:

.. code:: ipython3

    defaults.meterNumerator




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4



.. code:: ipython3

    defaults.meterDenominator




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'quarter'



(Some of these examples use a system that automatically tries to get an
appropriate time signature and appropriate clef; in this case,
``music21`` figured out that that low B-flat would be easier to see in
bass clef than treble.)

We'll learn how to switch the :class:`~music21.meter.TimeSignature`
soon enough.

If you don't have MIDI or MusicXML configured yet (we'll get to it in a
second) and you don't want to have other programs open up, you can show
a ``Stream`` in text in your editor:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
    {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
    {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


This display shows the ``offset`` for each element (that is, each object
in the Stream) along with what class it is, and a little bit more
helpful information. The information is the same as what's called the
``__repr__`` (representation) of the object, which is what you get if
you type its variable name at the prompt:

.. code:: ipython3

    note1




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>



By the way, Streams have a ``__repr__`` as well:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.stream.Stream 0x1073bf160>



that number at the end is the hex form of the ``.id`` of the ``Stream``,
which is a way of identifying it. Often the ``.id`` of a Stream will be
the name of the ``Part`` ("Violin II"), but if it's undefined then a
somewhat random number is used (actually the location of the Stream in
your computer's memory). We can change the ``.id`` of a Stream:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.id = 'some_notes'
    stream1




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.stream.Stream some_notes>



We could have also changed the ``.id`` of any of our ``Note`` objects,
but it doesn't show up in the ``Note``'s ``__repr__``:

.. code:: ipython3

    note1.id = 'my_favorite_C'
    note1




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note C>



Now, a ``Stream`` is a :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object` just like
a ``Note`` is. This is why it has an ``.id`` attribute and, more
importantly, why you can call ``.show()`` on it.

What else makes a ``Music21Object`` what it is? It has a ``.duration``
attribute which stores a ``Duration`` object:

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.duration




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.duration.Duration 4.0>



.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.duration.type




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'whole'



.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.duration.quarterLength




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4.0



(Notice that the ``len()`` of a ``Stream``, which stands for "length",
is not the same as the duration. the ``len()`` of a Stream is the number
of objects stored in it, so ``len(stream1)`` is 3).

A related concept to the ``.duration`` of a Stream is its
``.highestTime``, which is the time at which the latest element in the
``Stream`` ends. Usually this is the last element of the stream's
``.offset`` plus its ``.quarterLength``.

.. code:: ipython3

    stream1.highestTime




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    4.0



Streams within Streams
----------------------

And, as a ``Music21Object``, a ``Stream`` can be placed inside of
another ``Stream`` object. Let's create a stream, called biggerStream
(for reasons that will become obvious), that holds a ``Note`` D# at the
beginning

.. code:: ipython3

    biggerStream = stream.Stream()
    note2 = note.Note("D#5")
    biggerStream.insert(0, note2)

Now we use the ``.append`` functionality to put ``stream1`` at the end
of ``biggerStream``:

.. code:: ipython3

    biggerStream.append(stream1)

Notice that when we call ``.show('text')`` on biggerStream, we see not
only the presence of ``note2`` and ``stream1`` but also all the contents
of ``stream1`` as well:

.. code:: ipython3

    biggerStream.show('text') 


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.note.Note D#>
    {1.0} <music21.stream.Stream some_notes>
        {0.0} <music21.note.Note C>
        {2.0} <music21.note.Note F#>
        {3.0} <music21.note.Note B->


Notice though that the offsets, the little numbers inside curly
brackets, for the elements of ``stream1`` ("some notes") relate only to
their positions within ``stream1``, not to their position within
``biggerStream``. This is because each ``Music21Object`` knows its
offset only in relation to its containing ``Stream``, not necessarily to
the ``Stream`` containing *that* ``Stream``.

Also notice that ``note1`` knows that it is in ``stream1`` but doesn't
know that it is somewhere inside ``biggerStream``:

.. code:: ipython3

    note1 in stream1




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True



.. code:: ipython3

    note1 in biggerStream




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    False



All this might not seem like much of a big deal, until we tell you that
in music21, ``Scores`` are made up of ``Streams`` within ``Streams``
within ``Streams``. So if you have an orchestral score, it is a
``Stream``, and the viola part is a ``Stream`` in that ``Stream``, and
measure 5 of the viola part is a ``Stream`` within that ``Stream``, and,
if there were a ''divisi'', then each ''diviso'' voice would be a
``Stream`` within that ``Stream``. Each of these ``Streams`` has a
special name and its own class (:class:`~music21.stream.Score`,
:class:`~music21.stream.Part`, :class:`~music21.stream.Measure`, and
:class:`~music21.stream.Voice`), but they are all types of
``Streams``.

So how do we find ``note1`` inside ``biggerStream``? That's what the
next two chapters are about.

Colleagues and Institutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music21 is unthinkable without our colleagues and friends
working on other music and technology projects, in particular:

* `David Huron`_, inventor of `Humdrum`_ (the link refers to a changed version of the project),
   the inspiration for music21.

* `Michael Good`_ and Recordare.com for creating MusicXML and many
   discussions about the project.

* The `Center for Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities`_ at Stanford University,
  contributing to the knowledge of music since 1984, and
  publishers of *Computing in Musicology*.

   support and for their contributions to the open source music notation projects,
   including the Bach Goldberg Variations and the Handel Arias included.

* `Donald Byrd`_, researcher on University of Indiana who created
   a schema for computer-aided musicology (along with the source of all sorts of
   examples of how music notation is difficult).

* `Jack Campin`_ has kindly given permission to distribute his ABC editions of the Aird
  Collection, the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, and the Colonial and Civil War American

   collection of the Bach chorales in MusicXML format as part of the music21 corpus.
   Her website contains all these chorales in additional formats.
   Any discoveries we make regarding these chorales are done in her memory.

* Bret Aarden for kindly contributing his conversions of Palestrina Mass corpus to `music21`.

* Walter B. Hewlett and Craig Sapp of Stanford's CCARH for support.

* `Justin London` compiled and maintained the list of Second-Viennese
   row forms now available in serial.py.

   Cumming, Andrew Hankinson, and especially Christopher Antila for contributing.

* `Manuel Op de Coul`_ has kindly gave permission to use the Scala
   scale archive of nearly 4000 scales in music21.

* `Seymour Shlien`_ has kindly given permission to distribute his ABC
   encodings of the Essen folksong database with music21.

* `Bryen Travis`_ has kindly gave permission to use his collection of
   Bach MIDI data in `music21`.  It is no longer included in the Corpus, but we
   continue to thank him for his generosity.

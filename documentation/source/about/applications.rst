Applications and Extensions of `music21`
=============================================

`Music21` has been used in numerous research tasks already, and will continue
to offer researchers many tools with which to explore new domains.

Future Goals and Potential Applications
---------------------------------------------------

There are numerous applications for music21 that we anticipate, yet simply have not had
time to implement. Consider taking on one of these projects, or write us with new and
interesting suggestions. To contact the authors, visit :ref:`about`.

- Piano-key-visualization

- Slonimsky scale types

- Automatic clarinet fingering generation via ClarFinger font (link: www.trecento.com/fonts/)

- Automatic string fingerings.

- Indian Raga encoding: including ascending, descending, and typical presentations,
  microtonal inflections, common associations, historical context.

- Multiple-simultaneous-tempi to a single tempo conversion (via tuplets).

- Palestrina counterpoint generation (via algorithms of Mary Farbood and others.).

- Beneventan chant similarity indices (thanks to the work of Thomas Forrest Kelly and the
  Exultet encodings made available in `**kern` by Elsa De Luca).

- Identify potential clefs for fragmentary Renaissance and Medieval pieces that are
  missing their clefs. (Use their staff-lines and minimizing number of melodic and
  harmonic tritones).

**Michael Cuthbert**, the creator of `music21`, is co-founder and chief music officer of
`Artusi`_ and former tenured professor of music at M.I.T. where he created the Mellon-Funded
Digital Humanities lab and taught computational music theory and musicology.
He received his A.B. *summa cum laude*, A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University.
Cuthbert spent 2004-05 at the American Academy as a Rome Prize winner in Medieval Studies,
2009-10 as Fellow at Harvard's Villa I Tatti Center for Italian Renaissance Studies
in Florence, and 2012-13 at the Radcliffe Institute.

Prior to joining the M.I.T. faculty, Cuthbert was on the faculties of Smith
and Mount Holyoke Colleges.  He has worked extensively on computer-aided musical analysis,
fourteenth-century music, and the music since 1960.

**Christopher Ariza** is Emeritus Lead Programmer of `music21` and was
Visiting Assistant Professor of Music
at M.I.T. from 2010 to 2013.  Prior to joining the `music21` project,
Ariza was Assistant Professor of Music
Technology at Towson University in Baltimore.  He has published and
presented numerous articles
and papers on algorithmic composition and generative music systems.
Ariza received his A.B.
degree from Harvard University and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from New York University.

Colleagues and Institutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music21 is unthinkable without our colleagues and friends
working on other music and technology projects, in particular:

* `David Huron`_, inventor of `Humdrum`_ (the link refers to a changed version of the project),
   the inspiration for music21.

* `Michael Good`_ and Recordare.com for creating MusicXML and many
   discussions about the project.

* The `Center for Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities`_ at Stanford University,
  contributing to the knowledge of music since 1984, and
  publishers of *Computing in Musicology*.

Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, the following individuals have contributed materials or knowledge
to this project.  Their contributions and generosity are greatly appreciated.

* Thomas Bonte, Nicholas Froment, and Werner Schweer of `MuseScore`_ for their
   support and for their contributions to the open source music notation projects,
   including the Bach Goldberg Variations and the Handel Arias included.

* `Jacob Walls`_, contributed greatly to the type-safety, speed, and test coverage
   of `music21`.  If your music21 program "just works" without needing to guess what
   any argument goes where, Jacob is to thank.

* `Donald Byrd`_, researcher on University of Indiana who created
   a schema for computer-aided musicology (along with the source of all sorts of
   examples of how music notation is difficult).

* `Jack Campin`_ has kindly given permission to distribute his ABC editions of the Aird
  Collection, the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, and the Colonial and Civil War American
  Fife Music Collection.

* `John Chambers`_ has provided ABC editions to distribute with music21, including the
  Aird Collection, the O'Neill's Music of Ireland Collection, and Ryan's Mammoth Collection
  of fiddle tunes.

* `Laura E. Conrad`_ has kindly given permission to distribute her ABC editions of
  renaissance polyphony from Serpent Publications.

* `Ewa Dahlig-Turek`_ has kindly given permission to distribute the
   Essen folksong database with music21.

* `Margaret Greentree` kindly gave permission for distribution of her edited
   collection of the Bach chorales in MusicXML format as part of the music21 corpus.
   Her website contains all these chorales in additional formats.
   Any discoveries we make regarding these chorales are done in her memory.

* Bret Aarden for kindly contributing his conversions of Palestrina Mass corpus to `music21`.

* Walter B. Hewlett and Craig Sapp of Stanford's CCARH for support.

* `Justin London` compiled and maintained the list of Second-Viennese
   row forms that form the original backbone of serial.py.

* `McGill University`_ ELVIS project for including the MEI parser. Special thanks to Julie
   Cumming, Andrew Hankinson, Ichiro Fujinaga, and especially Christopher Antila for contributing.

* `Manuel Op de Coul`_ has kindly gave permission to use the Scala
   scale archive of nearly 4000 scales in music21.

* `Seymour Shlien`_ has kindly given permission to distribute his ABC
   encodings of the Essen folksong database with music21.

* `Bryen Travis`_ has kindly gave permission to use his collection of
   Bach MIDI data in `music21`.  It is no longer included in the Corpus, but we
   continue to thank him for his generosity.

* `Project Gutenberg`_ houses public domain music, including the quartets of Beethoven,
  Haydn, and Mozart, in musicxml format which we have been able to include in music21.

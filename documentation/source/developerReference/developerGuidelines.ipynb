    "## Style Guide ##\n",
    "\n",
    "`Music21` began in Perl. Now it interfaces with the TypeScript package `music21j`.\n",
    "Both of those languages use `camelCase` extensively. For these reasons,\n",
    "as well as for backward compatibility, we adhere to `camelCase`\n",
    "naming--rather than Python PEP8 `snake_case` naming--for public APIs such as method names,\n",
    "arguments, and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, snake_case is acceptable in new contributions\n",
    "for *internal variables* that are not exposed publicly. Some screen readers can\n",
    "pronounce these names better and make them more accessible (however, more modern\n",
    "screen readers seem to do well with camelCase).\n",
    "However, all exposed methods and functions and their exposed arguments **must**\n",
    "be in camelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Strings MUST be 'single-quoted', but \"double quotes\" are allowed internally**\n",
    "    - This rule applies to triple quotes and doc strings also, contrary to PEP 257.\n",
    "    - Docstrings must begin and end on their own lines.  No one-line doc-strings or text\n",
    "      immediately following the triple quotes.\n",
    "    - When there is a hyphen or single quote in the string, double quotes should be used,\n",
    "      not escaping/backslashing.\n",
    "    - For long streams of TinyNotation or Lilypond code, which both use single quotes to indicate octave,\n",
    "       triple single quotes around the string are better than double quotes.  Internal whitespace\n",
    "       rarely matters in those formats.\n",
    "    - Documentation should follow quoting in American English grammar when not\n",
    "       discussing code.  So for instance, a quotation in documentation is in double quotes.\n",
    "  - Variable names:\n",
    "    - Need to be unambiguous, even if rather long.\n",
    "    - Must begin with lowercase (or underscore + lowercase) unless they represent classes.\n",
    "    - snake_case is allowed for private variables.\n",
    "    - camelCase is required for public.\n",
    "  - Line lengths are capped at 100, but if approaching this limit, look for ways to avoid one-lining.\n",
    "    - if it's easy to split your line into two which are both under 80 characters, do so.\n",
    "  - Line continuation characters (`\\`) are not allowed; use open parentheses.\n",
    "  - Prefer f-strings to `.format()`.  The `%` interpolation is no longer allowed.\n",
    "  - Annotating types is **required** in new code, and encouraged to be added to older code.\n",
    "    - e.g. `self.counter: int = 0` or `def makeNoises() -> list['noise.Noise']:`\n",
    "    - The typing library should always be imported as `t`.\n",
    "    - Use `type | None` rather than `t.Optional[type]`.\n",
    "  - Prefer enums to string configurations\n",
    "    - In music21.common.enums, there is a StrEnum class for nearly-backwards compatible\n",
    "       replacement of a former string argument with an enum.\n",
    "    - New Enums do not need to inherit from StrEnum or IntEnum.\n",
    "    - Enum members should be in ALL_CAPS with underscores, unless there is a good reason (such\n",
    "      as case differentiation) to use CamelCase.  I personally hate this convention--it looks\n",
    "      like shouting--and will revisit it if `music21` is ever ported to a language where\n",
    "      this is not the convention.  Do not leave out underscores in the member names; it makes\n",
    "      it hard for people whose native language is not English to parse and impossible for\n",
    "      screen readers.\n",
    "  - New classes should strongly endeavor to follow Liskov Substitution Principle.\n",
    "    - Exceptions may be granted if the class structures follow names that are in common musical use\n",
    "      but whose real world objects do not follow this principle.  For instance, a `Manx` is a subclass\n",
    "      of `Cat` without `self.tail`.  Sometimes, however, rewriting the superclass might be possible\n",
    "      (perhaps `self.tail: t.Optional[Tail]`).\n",
    "    - `Music21` was originally designed without this principle in mind, so you will find\n",
    "      parts of the system that do not follow LSP and for backwards compatibility never will.\n",
    "      I (Myke) have personally apologized to Barbara Liskov for my past ignorance.\n",
    "  - Use [Sphinx formatting](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/developerReference/documenting.html#documenting-modules-and-classes)\n",
    "      to link to classes and methods in docstrings\n",
    "  - Prefer methods that by default do not alter the object passed in and instead return a new one.\n",
    "      It is permitted and encouraged to have an `inPlace: bool = False` argument that allows for\n",
    "      manipulation of the original object.  When `inPlace` is True, nothing should be returned\n",
    "      (not true for `music21j` since passing through objects is so expected in JavaScript thanks\n",
    "      to JQuery and other libraries).  Use the `@overload` decorator to show how this parameter\n",
    "      affects the return value -- Python makes this a bit hard, but see for instance, :meth:`~music21.stream.base.Stream.getElementsByClass` for an example of how to use this.\n",
    "  - Use descriptive pull request titles (rather than GitHub's default \"Update pitch.py\")\n",
    "    - Do not have a PR title so long that it cannot be seen in one line.  Simplify and\n",
    "      rewrite and go into more detail in the description.  I depend on skimming PR titles\n",
    "      to prepare reports of changes.\n",
    "    - Don't turn a PR into a general discussion of something not included in the PR.\n",
    "      Make an issue and link to the PR from there.\n",
    "  - Write the word `music21` in lowercase in the middle of a sentence and as `Music21` at\n",
    "    the beginning of a sentence.  Avoid beginning a sentence with a module name, but if\n",
    "    it has to be done, write it in lowercase, obviously.  In contexts where possible,\n",
    "    `music21` should be stylized in monospaced (with slab serifs, like old typewriters).\n"

    "## Arguments and Keywords in classes, methods, and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines come from [GitHub issue 1389](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21/issues/1389); any further discussion should take place there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These guidelines have been in place since music21 v8 (Fall 2022).  All older functions can continue as is, but should be updated when possible.  The existence of older functions that violates these rules cannot be cited as precedent.\n",
    "2. Functions can have no more than 3 positional arguments, and should only include ones used most often.\n",
    "    - Methods may have \"self\" + 3 positional arguments\n",
    "    - Any remaining arguments should be keyword only\n",
    "    - When adding new functionality to existing functions, nearly always, a keyword-only argument is the right choice.\n",
    "    - The order of arguments should make sense: numerator -> denominator,  from -> to.  If it's likely to be confused (especially if two variables are the same type), better to use keyword only.\n",
    "3. For arbitrary positional and keyword arguments that are not parsed, the names are `*arguments, **keywords`.  #1377 has made this rename for `**keywords` -- this change was easy since `**kwargs` is daunting to new users (I remember not knowing what it meant).  The choice of `*args` vs `*arguments` was tough, since `*args` is more obvious what it means than `**kwargs`, and `*arguments` is longer; they are used about equally in existing code.  The decision was based on `*arguments` being more explicit, AND being longer to type is a slight ADVANTAGE since this Issue discourages using it.  And, this should be a moot issue in any case, because of rules below.\n",
    "4.  Functions should NOT look at `**keywords`. [See GitHub issue #839](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21/issues/839) -- any members that will be used in the function must be explicitly mentioned in the function signature.\n",
    "    - So instead of `if 'myOption' in keywords...` put `myOption: t.Optional[Something] = None` in the signature of the function.\n",
    "    - An exception is granted for multiple inheritance to examine the `**keywords` dict to split it for two different\n",
    "     constructors which use the same key to mean something different.\n",
    "    - Keyword arguments should be keyword-only by using `*`\n",
    "      to consume any other positional arguments: `def makeNoise(self, volume, *, color=noise.PINK):`\n",
    "5. Methods can have a generic `**keywords` at the end of the constructor signature which is assumed to be passed up the inheritance chain to the superclass for its own keywords (or its superclass's own keywords, etc.).  This is required for Music21Object subclasses. This way other Music21Objects don't have to deal with `duration`, `groups`, `style`, etc. and can pass it up the chain.  It is especially important for `id` since this requires pylint exemptions, etc.\n",
    "6. The only use of `(*arguments, **keywords)` is for a quick subclass that needs to keep track of something else along the way and we want to avoid the maintenance burden of, e.g., updating Marcato whenever the signature of Music21Object, Articulation, etc. changes.  Core and often used subclasses should know what the signatures of their superclasses are and write their constructors accordingly.  The use of common.types shortcuts, such as OffsetQL (for types that are allowed as offset or quarterLength values) should be used to avoid writing long and variable types over and over.  Even here, don't use `*arguments` if the superclass does not have arguments currently.\n",
    "7. Aside from the case above `*arguments` should only be used in cases where the number of arguments is actually unlimited, all have the same type as each other, and all have the same meaning.  E.g., Chord, has an arbitrary number of Note, Pitch, or string arguments can be passed in separated by commas.  Code should not have things like what Tuplet currently has, where `*arguments` can only have 2 or 3 entries and the first means `numNotesActual: int`, the second `numNotesNormal: int`, and the third `durationActual: str|DurationTuple`.  These can be normal arguments which can be specified by position or keyword.\n",
    "8. When `*arguments` are used properly (like in Chord) the variable name should reflect the type of thing expected, e.g., `*notes`.  (Or in the case of Chord which can also take a list of notes, `(self, noteListOrFirstNote, *remainingNotes)` )\n",
    "9. Use positional-only arguments only when there is a variable type argument like \"noteOrStringOrListOfNotes\" which you'd rather that users not specify by keyword, AND there are keyword alternates like `n=..., s=..., nList=...` so that people can specify what they are putting in.  Interval() has been refactored to use positional-only arguments.  In general, do not use positional-only arguments.\n",
    "10. Document all arguments in the docstring.  Arguments that become stored in attributes (not properties) should be documented and tested in `_DOC_ATTR = {}`.  Those that are manipulated and not stored directly should be tested in the docstring or unittests.\n"

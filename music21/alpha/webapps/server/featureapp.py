'''
An interface for music21 using mod_wsgi

To use, first install mod_wsgi and include it in the HTTPD.conf file.

Add this file to the server, ideally not in the document root, 
on mac this could be /Library/WebServer/wsgi-scripts/zipfileapp.py

Then edit the HTTPD.conf file to redirect any requests to WEBSERVER:/music21interface 
to call this file:
Note: unlike with mod_python, the end of the URL does not determine which function is called,
WSGIScriptAlias always calls application.

WSGIScriptAlias /music21/zipfileinterface /Library/WebServer/wsgi-scripts/zipfileapp.py

Further down the conf file, give the webserver access to this directory:

<Directory "/Library/WebServer/wsgi-scripts">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

The mod_wsgi handler will call the application function below with the request
content in the environ variable.

To use the application, send a POST request to WEBSERVER:/music21interface
where the contents of the POST is a POST from a form containing a zip file.

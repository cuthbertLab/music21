# see feature list here:
# http://docs.pylint.org/features.html

# W0511:	Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.
# W0404:	Reimport %r (imported line %s) Used when a module is reimported multiple times.
# we do this all the time in unit tests
# R0201:	Method could be a function Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as a function.
# R0904:	Too many public methods (%s/%s) Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a more simple (and so easier to use) class.
# E1101:	%s %r has no %r member Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistant member.
# R0914:	Too many local variables (%s/%s) Used when a function or method has too many local variables.
# many of our test use many local variables
# R0903:	Too few public methods (%s/%s) Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
# R0911:	Too many return statements (%s/%s) Used when a function or method has too many return statement, making it hard to follow.

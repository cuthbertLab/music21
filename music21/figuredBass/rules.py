    A Rules object is provided as an input to a :class:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment`,
    and controls the application of methods designed to filter out undesired possibilities in
    a single Segment or undesired progressions between two consecutive Segments.


    The rules are categorized in an identical manner to methods
    in :mod:`~music21.figuredBass.possibility`:


    1) Single Possibility Rules. These rules apply to any possibility within a
    single Segment (possibA), and
    are applied in finding correct possibilities for a Segment
    in :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.allCorrectSinglePossibilities`.


    2) Consecutive Possibility Rules. These rules apply between any correct
    single possibility in segmentA
    (possibA) and any correct single possibility in segmentB (possibB),
    segmentB coming directly after segmentA.
    They are applied in finding correct (possibA, possibB) pairs between
    two Segments
    in :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.allCorrectConsecutivePossibilities`.


    3) Special Resolution Rules. These rules apply to Segments
    whose :attr:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.segmentChord` is an
    augmented sixth, dominant seventh, or diminished seventh chord, and are
    applied as necessary in
    :meth:`~music21.figuredBass.segment.Segment.allCorrectConsecutivePossibilities`.

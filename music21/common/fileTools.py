    Slow, but will read a file of unknown encoding as safely as possible using
    the chardet package.

    Let's try to load this file as ascii -- it has a copyright symbol at the top,
    so it won't load in Python3:

    >>> import os
    >>> c = str(common.getSourceFilePath() / 'common' / '__init__.py')
    >>> #_DOCS_SHOW f = open(c)
    >>> #_DOCS_SHOW data = f.read()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position ...:
        ordinal not in range(128)

    That won't do! now I know that it is in utf-8, but maybe you don't. Or it could
    be an old humdrum or Noteworthy file with unknown encoding.  This will load it safely.

    >>> data = common.readFileEncodingSafe(c)
    >>> data[0:30]
    '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# ----'

    Well, that's nothing, since the first guess here is utf-8, and it's right. So let's
    give a worse first guess:

    >>> data = common.readFileEncodingSafe(c, firstGuess='SHIFT_JIS')  # old Japanese standard
    >>> data[0:30]
    '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# ----'

    It worked!

    Note that this is slow enough if it gets it wrong that the firstGuess should be set
    to something reasonable like 'ascii' or 'utf-8'.

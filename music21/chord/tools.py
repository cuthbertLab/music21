Chord utilities too obscure to go on the Chord object, yet still helpful
enough to go in the music21 core library.

    Return a dictionary of all chordSteps in the chord.
    If more than one pitch shares the same chordStep such as the third
    in (C, E-, E, G), then only the first will appear in the dictionary.

    The dictionary will be ordered by the order of pitches in the Chord.

    More efficient than calling [getChordStep(x) for x in range(1, 8)]
    which would be O(n^2) on number of pitches.

    Requires `root()` to be defined.

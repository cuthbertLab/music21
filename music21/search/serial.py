class ContiguousSegmentSearcher:
    '''
    Class that when given a :class:`~music21.stream.Stream`
    and `.byLength()` is called, returns a
    :class:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes` objects
    where the desired number of notes in the segment is specified.

    The inputStream is a Score or Part or Opus containing one score..
    Furthermore, all notes must be contained within measures.

    The reps argument specifies how repeated pitch classes are dealt with.
    It may be set to 'skipConsecutive' (default), 'rowsOnly', 'includeAll', or 'ignoreAll'.
    These are explained in detail below.

    The includeChords argument specifies how chords are dealt with. When set to True (default),
    the pitches of all chords
    are read in order from bottom to top, and when set to False, all segments containing
    chords are ignored.

    The main subtleties of this function lie in how each reps setting works in
    conjunction with chords when
    `includeChords` is set to `True`, and how the lengths of the segments are measured.
    However, let us first examine what happens when includeChords
    is set to `False`, to get an idea of how the function works.

    To begin, we create a stream on which we will apply the function.

    >>> s = stream.Stream()
    >>> n1 = note.Note('e4')
    >>> n1.quarterLength = 6
    >>> s.append(n1)
    >>> n2 = note.Note('f4')
    >>> n2.quarterLength = 1
    >>> s.append(n2)
    >>> n3 = chord.Chord(['g4', 'b4'])
    >>> n3.quarterLength = 1
    >>> s.append(n3)
    >>> n4 = note.Note('g4')
    >>> n4.quarterLength = 1
    >>> s.repeatAppend(n4, 2)
    >>> n5 = note.Note('a4')
    >>> n5.quarterLength = 3
    >>> s.repeatAppend(n5, 2)
    >>> n6 = note.Note('b4')
    >>> n6.quarterLength = 1
    >>> s.append(n6)
    >>> n7 = note.Note('c5')
    >>> n7.quarterLength = 1
    >>> s.append(n7)

    We can now try to apply this function:

    >>> searcher = search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher(s, 'skipConsecutive', False)
    >>> contiguousList = searcher.byLength(3)
    >>> print(contiguousList)
    [<music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['G4', 'A4', 'B4']>,
     <music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['A4', 'B4', 'C5']>]

    .. image:: images/serial-findTransposedSegments.png
       :width: 500

    We now can apply the function, and in doing so we examine in detail each of the reps settings.

    'skipConsecutive' means that whenever immediate repetitions of notes or chords occur,
    only the first instance of the note or chord is included in the segment.
    The durations of the repeated notes,
    do not have to be the same.

    >>> searcher = search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher(s, includeChords=False)
    >>> searcher.reps = 'skipConsecutive'

    >>> skipConsecutiveList = searcher.byLength(3)
    >>> print(skipConsecutiveList)
    [<music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['G4', 'A4', 'B4']>,
     <music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['A4', 'B4', 'C5']>]

    >>> [instance.segment for instance in skipConsecutiveList]
    [[<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>],
     [<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>]]


    In order to be considered repetition, the spellings of the notes
    in question must be exactly the same:
    enharmonic equivalents are not checked and notes with the
    same pitch in different octaves are considered different.
    To illustrate this, see the example below, in which all three notes,
    with pitch class 0, are considered
    separately.

    >>> new = stream.Stream()
    >>> n1 = note.Note('c4')
    >>> n2 = note.Note('c5')
    >>> n3 = note.Note('b#5')
    >>> new.append(n1)
    >>> new.append(n2)
    >>> new.append(n3)
    >>> new = new.makeMeasures()

    >>> searcherNew = search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher(new,
    ...       reps='skipConsecutive', includeChords=False)
    >>> foundSegments = searcherNew.byLength(3)
    >>> [seg.segment for seg in foundSegments]
    [[<music21.note.Note C>, <music21.note.Note C>, <music21.note.Note B#>]]


    'rowsOnly' searches only for tone rows, in which all pitch classes
    in the segment must be distinct. Below,
    we are looking for sequences three consecutive notes within the
    stream `s`, all of which have different pitch classes.
    There is only one such set of notes, and by calling the
    :attr:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes` we can
    determine its location (the measure number of its first note).

    We'll return to our original searcher, but make sure that it has measures now:

    >>> searcher = search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher(s.makeMeasures(), includeChords=False)
    >>> searcher.reps = 'rowsOnly'
    >>> rowsOnlyList = searcher.byLength(3)
    >>> [(instance.segment, instance.startMeasureNumber) for instance in rowsOnlyList]
    [([<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>], 4)]

    'includeAll' disregards all repetitions, and simply gets all
    contiguous segments of the specified length (still subject
    to the includeChords setting).

    >>> searcher.reps = 'includeAll'
    >>> includeAllList = searcher.byLength(3)
    >>> for instance in includeAllList:
    ...     print(instance.segment, instance.startMeasureNumber, instance.startOffset)
    [<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>] 3 0.0
    [<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note A>] 3 1.0
    [<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>] 3 2.0
    [<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>] 4 1.0

    Note that there only two total As appear in these segments, despite there being three
    :class:`~music21.note.Note` objects with the A4 as the pitch
    in the stream s; this is because only the first note of each set
    of tied notes is considered. This convention applies to this
    function and all parsing functions below.
    Also note that so far, neither of the first two notes n1, n2
    nor the major third n3 in `s` have been included in any of the
    returned contiguous segments. This is because for each of these,
    any instance of three consecutive notes or chords
    contains the chord n3. This phenomenon also applies to the next example below.

    Finally, when includeChords is set to False, 'ignoreAll' finds all
    contiguous segments containing exactly three distinct pitch
    classes within it. It is unique in that unlike the previous three
    reps settings, the segments returned in fact
    have more than the number of notes specified (3). Rather, they
    each have 3 distinct pitch classes, and some pitch classes
    may be repeated.

    >>> searcher.reps = 'ignoreAll'
    >>> ignoreAllList = searcher.byLength(3)
    >>> [instance.segment for instance in ignoreAllList]
    [[<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note A>,
      <music21.note.Note B>],
     [<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>],
     [<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>],
     [<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>]]

    Let us now examine what happens in the default chord setting,
    in which includeChords is set to True.

    There are two points to remember when considering chords: the first is that all
    chords are read as sequences of single notes,
    from bottom to top. The second is that 'length' always applies to the total
    number of single pitches or pitch classes found
    in the segment, including within chords, and not to the number of notes or chords.
    However, as we will see, when we search
    for contiguous segments of length 4, the returned segments may not have exactly
    4 total notes (possibly existing
    as single notes or within chords), a natural point of confusion.

    Below is a new stream s0.

    >>> s0 = stream.Stream()
    >>> n1 = note.Note('d4')
    >>> maj2nd = chord.Chord(['f4', 'g4'])
    >>> bMaj1 = chord.Chord(['b4', 'd#5', 'f#5'])
    >>> bMaj2 = chord.Chord(['b4', 'd#5', 'f#5'])
    >>> n2 = note.Note('f#4')
    >>> n3 = note.Note('e4')
    >>> n4 = note.Note('a4')
    >>> s0.append([n1, maj2nd, bMaj1, bMaj2, n2, n3, n4])
    >>> s0 = s0.makeMeasures()
    >>> #_DOCS_SHOW s0.show()

    .. image:: images/serial-getContiguousSegmentsOfLength2.png
       :width: 500

    >>> searcher = search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher(s0, 'skipConsecutive', True)
    >>> skipConsecutiveWithChords = searcher.byLength(4)
    >>> [seg.segment for seg in skipConsecutiveWithChords]
    [[<music21.note.Note D>, <music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>, <music21.note.Note F#>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>, <music21.note.Note F#>, <music21.note.Note E>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>, <music21.note.Note F#>, <music21.note.Note E>,
      <music21.note.Note A>]]

    Let us look closely at the found segments. First, because reps
    was set to 'skipConsecutive', the second
    B major chord (bMaj2) is never considered, as the chord right
    before it is the same. As was mentioned before,
    not all the segments found have exactly 4 notes total.
    This is because, for each segment, only a subset
    of the notes contained in the first and last elements are read. Given one of the
    found segments, it will always
    be possible to extract exactly four consecutive pitches from the notes and chords,
    reading in order, so that
    at least one pitch is taken from each of the first and last chords.

    In the first segment, there is one way to extract 4 consecutive pitches:
    we take the D in the first note, read
    the F and G (in that order) from the next chord, and finally,
    reading the last chord from bottom to top, the B
    from the B major chord. Note that no other reading of the segment
    is possible because the D from the first note
    must be used. The second segment in the returned list, on the other
    hand, can be read as a sequence of 4
    consecutive pitches in two ways, both equally valid. We can either take
    the top note of the first chord, and all three
    notes, in order, of the second chord, or both notes of the first chord
    and the bottom two notes of the second chord.

    >>> searcher.reps = 'rowsOnly'
    >>> rowsOnlyChords = searcher.byLength(4)
    >>> rowsOnlyChords
    [<music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['D4', 'F4 G4', 'B4 D#5 F#5']>,
     <music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['F4 G4', 'B4 D#5 F#5']>]

    >>> [seg.segment for seg in rowsOnlyChords]
    [[<music21.note.Note D>, <music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>]]

    When reps is set to 'rowsOnly', the segments returned are those such that
    each may be read as a sequence
    of 4 pitches, in the same manner as explained above with the 'skipConsecutive' setting,
    such that the sequence
    of 4 pitches constitutes a four-note tone row. Above, the first segment
    corresponds to the row [2, 5, 7, 11], and the
    second may be read as either [5, 7, 11, 3] or [7, 11, 3, 6]. Note that, for example,
    we could not include both
    the B-major chord and the F# that comes right after it in the same segment,
    because there would have to be two
    consecutive instances of the pitch class 6 (corresponding to F#). Similarly,
    we could not include both instances
    of the B-major chord, as, again, we would have a pitch class repeated in
    any resulting four-note row.

    >>> searcher.reps = 'includeAll'
    >>> includeAll = searcher.byLength(4)
    >>> [seg.segment for seg in includeAll]
    [[<music21.note.Note D>, <music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>],
     [<music21.chord.Chord F4 G4>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 D#5 F#5>],

    Here, all segments from which sequences of four consecutive pitches can be extracted,
    again with at least
    one pitch coming from each of the first and last elements of the segments, are found.

    When reps is set to 'ignoreAll', the pitch classes from each segment are read by taking,
    in order, the pitch classes
    in the order in which they first appear, where chords are again read from bottom to top.
    For example, in the last segment,
    the first three pitch classes are those in the first chord, from
    bottom to top: 11, 3, and 6. Then, the next pitch class
    appearing is 6, which is disregarded because it has already appeared.
    Finally, the pitch classes 4 and 9 appear in that order.
    There are thus five pitch classes in this segment, in the order [11, 3, 6, 4, 9].

    The segment can be read has having length 4 because four consecutive
    pitch classes, [3, 6, 4, 9], can be read from this sequence
    in such a way that the first pitch class of this subsequence is part of the
    first chord in the segment, and the last pitch class
    is that of the last note of the segment. More generally, in this setting the
    found segments are those which contain at least 4
    distinct pitch classes, but the top note of the first chord (or note), the
    bottom note of the last chord (or note),
    and all pitches of all notes and chords other than the first and last
    contain at most 4 distinct pitch classes.

class SegmentMatcher:
    '''
    Matches all the ContiguousSegmentsOfNotes (found by ContiguousSegmentSearcher)
    within a :class:`~music21.stream.Stream`
    to one or more segments of pitch classes.

    The inputStream is a :class:`~music21.stream.Stream`; as
    in :class:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher`,
    the inputStream can contain at most one :class:`~music21.stream.Score` and
    its notes must be contained in measures. The searchList is a list of contiguous segments to
    be searched for, each segment being given as a list of pitch classes.
    The reps and includeChords settings specify how
    repeated pitches and chords, respectively, are handled; the
    possible settings are the same as those in
    :class:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentSearcher`.

    Returns a list of :class:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes`
    objects for which the
    :attr:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes.activeSegment`
    matches at least one of the elements of the searchList,
    subject to the settings specified in reps and includeChords.

    >>> GABandABC[0].startMeasureNumber, GABandABC[1].startMeasureNumber
    (5, 6)

    In case it is not clear, we can use
    the :attr:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentsOfNotes.matchedSegment` property
    to determine, to which element of the original searchList the found
    contiguous segments were matched.

    >>> GABandABC[0].matchedSegment
    [7, 9, 11]
    >>> GABandABC[1].matchedSegment
    [9, 11, 0]

    One can also search for segments of different lengths, simultaneously.
    Below, 'B' refers to the
    pitch class 11, which only coincidentally is the same as that of the note B.

    >>> x = (matcher.find([[7, 9, 11], ['B', 0]]))
    >>> x
    [<music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['G4', 'A4', 'B4']>,
     <music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes ['B4', 'C5']>]

    Below, we can see what happens when we include the chords and use ignoreAll

    >>> matcher = search.serial.SegmentMatcher(sc, reps='ignoreAll', includeChords=True)
    >>> [seg.segment for seg in matcher.find([[5, 7, 'B']])]
    [[<music21.note.Note F>, <music21.chord.Chord G4 B4>]]


    As expected, the pitch classes found segment are read
    in the order 5, 7, 11 ('B'), as the pitches
    in the chord are read from bottom to top.

    Consider the following other example with chords, which is somewhat more complex:

    >>> sc0 = stream.Score()
    >>> p0 = stream.Part()
    >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c4', 'd4'])
    >>> c2 = chord.Chord(['e4', 'f4'])
    >>> p0.append(c1)
    >>> p0.append(c2)
    >>> p0 = p0.makeMeasures()
    >>> sc0.insert(0, p0)

    >>> matcher = search.serial.SegmentMatcher(sc0)
    >>> foundSegments = matcher.find([[0, 2, 4]])
    >>> len(foundSegments)
    1
    >>> seg = foundSegments[0]
    >>> seg.segment
    [<music21.chord.Chord C4 D4>, <music21.chord.Chord E4 F4>]
    >>> seg.activeSegment
    [0, 2, 4]

    If we are just searching for a single term, the list-of-lists can be
    given just as a list:

    >>> foundSegments = matcher.find([2, 4, 5])
    >>> len(foundSegments)
    1

    In the two function calls, despite the fact that two different segments
    of pitch classes were searched for, the same
    :class:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes` object was found for each.
    This is because the found object can be read
    in two ways as a sequence of three pitch classes: either as [0, 2, 4], by
    taking the two notes of the first chord in order
    and the bottom note of the second, or as [2, 4, 5], by taking the top
    note of the first chord and the two notes of the second
    chord in order. Both times, the chords are read from bottom to top.

    First, note that it is impossible, using the 'ignoreAll' setting,
    to find segments, transposed or not,
    with repeated pitch classes.

    >>> matcher = search.serial.TransposedSegmentMatcher(newPart, 'ignoreAll')
    >>> matcher.find([0, 0])
    []

    A somewhat more interesting example is below.

    >>> matcher = search.serial.TransposedSegmentMatcher(newPart, 'rowsOnly',
    ...                                                            includeChords=False)
    >>> halfStepList = matcher.find([0, 1])
    >>> L = [step.segment for step in halfStepList]
    >>> print(L)
    [[<music21.note.Note E>, <music21.note.Note F>],
     [<music21.note.Note B>, <music21.note.Note C>]]
    >>> [step.startMeasureNumber for step in halfStepList]
    [1, 5]

    In addition to calling the
    :attr:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes.startMeasureNumber`
    property
    to return the measure numbers on which the half steps start, one may also call the
    :attr:`~music21.base.Music21Object.measureNumber` property of the
    first :class:`~music21.note.Note` of each segment.

    >>> s = stream.Stream()
    >>> s.repeatAppend(newPart, 2)  # s has two parts, each of which is a copy of newPart.

    >>> sMatcher = search.serial.TransposedSegmentMatcher(s, includeChords=False)
    >>> wholeStepList = sMatcher.find([12, 2])
    >>> [(step.segment, step.startMeasureNumber, step.partNumber) for step in wholeStepList]
    [([<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.note.Note A>], 3, 0),

    ([<music21.note.Note A>, <music21.note.Note B>], 3, 1)]

    Including chords works similarly as in :class:`~music21.search.serial.findSegments`.

    >>> sMatcher = search.serial.TransposedSegmentMatcher(newPart, includeChords=True)
    >>> foundSegments = sMatcher.find([4, 6, 'A'])

    We have thus found that the first instance of the row [2, 5, 4] within our

    [[('R', 3)],
     [('RI', 3)]]

    Pitch classes are extracted from segments in order of appearance, with
    pitches in chords being read from bottom to top.
    However, only the first instance of each pitch class is considered, as seen in the
    :attr:`~music21.search.serial.ContiguousSegmentOfNotes.activeSegment` calls.
    As long as the first and last pitch classes in the
    active segment first appear in the first and last elements of
    the found segment, respectively, the segment will be matched to the
    segment being searched for. To make this more clear, consider the
    following example in the same stream s:

    >>> tsMatcher = search.serial.TransformedSegmentMatcher(s, 'includeAll')
    >>> found = tsMatcher.find([4, 0, 4])
    >>> [(seg.segment, seg.activeSegment.pitchClasses()) for seg in found]
    [([<music21.note.Note G>, <music21.chord.Chord B4 G5 A5>], [7, 11, 7])]

    Above, the pitch classes of the found segment are read in the order 7, 11, 7, 9.
    Because a subsequence of this, [7, 11, 7],
    is an inversion of the search segment, [4, 0, 4], and furthermore,
    the first 7 is part of the first note of the segment (G), and
    the last 7 is part of the last chord of the segment, the found segment is
    matched to the segment being searched for.

    pitch class appears in one multiset is the same as
    the number of times the pitch class appears in the other multiset.

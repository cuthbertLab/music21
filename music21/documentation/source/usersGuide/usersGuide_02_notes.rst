User's Guide, Chapter 2: Notes
==============================

Notated music, by its very name, consists of a bunch of notes that are
put one after another or simultaneously on a staff. There are other
things, clefs, key signatures, slurs, etc. but the heart of music is the
notes; so to get anywhere in music21 you’ll need to know what the
toolkit thinks about notes and how to work with them.

Go ahead and start IDLE or type “python” at the command line (Terminal
on the Mac or “run: cmd” on Windows) and let’s get started.

Creating and working with Notes
-------------------------------

The music21 concept of a standard note is contained in the
:class:`~music21.note.Note` object, which is found in the ``note``
module.

**Read this if you're new to Python** *(others can skip ahead):* Notice
the difference between object names and module names. Modules, which can
contain one, many, or even zero objects, always begin with a lowercase
letter. Music21's objects always begin with a captial letter. So the
``Note`` object is found in the ``note`` module. The distinction between
uppercase and lowercase is crucial to Python: if you type the name of an
object with the wrong case it won't know what to do and won't give you
any help in distinguishing between them.

In the ``note`` module, there are other classes besides ``note.Note``.
The most important one is ``note.Rest``, which as you imagine represents
a rest. If we load music21 with the command:

.. code:: python

    from music21 import *

then you'll now be able to access the ``note`` module just by typing
``note`` at any command line.

>>> note # doctest: +SKIP
<module 'music21.note' from 'D:\music21files\music21\note.pyc'>

| If you get something like this you'll have access to the music21
``note`` module any time you type ``"note"``. The filename after "from
'D:\\music21files...'" will differ for you. It will show you where you
have music21 installed (if you ever forget where you have music21
installed, this is an easy way to figure it out).
| As long as it ends in ``note.pyc`` or ``note.py`` or something like
that you're fine.

If you want to know what else the ``note`` module contains besides the
Note and Rest objects you can type "``dir(note)``\ " to find out:

.. code:: python

    dir(note)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    ['GeneralNote',
     'Lyric',
     'LyricException',
     'NotRest',
     'NotRestException',
     'Note',
     'NoteException',
     'Rest',
     'SlottedObject',
     'SpacerRest',
     'Test',
     'TestExternal',
     'Unpitched',
     '_DOC_ORDER',
     '_MOD',
     '__builtins__',
     '__doc__',
     '__file__',
     '__name__',
     '__package__',
     'base',
     'beam',
     'common',
     'copy',
     'duration',
     'editorial',
     'environLocal',
     'environment',
     'exceptions21',
     'expressions',
     'interval',
     'noteheadTypeNames',
     'pitch',
     'stemDirectionNames',
     'tie',
     'unittest',
     'volume']


Some of the things in this list are classes of notes -- they are
capitalized. Other classes are things that we'll get to later, like
:class:`~music21.note.Lyric` objects. (By the way: I'm highlighting
the names of most objects so they become links to the full documentation
for the object. You can read it later when you're curious, frustrated,
or *Mad Men* is a re-run; you certainly don't need to click them now).

**(Advanced digression):**

If you're more of a Python guru and you're afraid of "polluting your
namespace," instead of typing "``from music21 import *``\ " you can
type:

.. code:: python

    import music21

in which case instead of using the word ``note``, you'll need to call it
``music21.note``

>>> music21.note # doctest: +SKIP
<module 'music21.note' from 'D:\music21files\music21\note.pyc'>
    
If you are a Python guru, you already knew that. Probably if you didn't
already know that, but you've heard about "polluting your namespace,"
you have a Python guru friend who has screamed, "Never use
``import *``!" Trust me for now that this tutorial will be easier if you
ignore your friend for a bit; by the end of it you'll know enough to be
able to follow whatever advice seems most natural to you.

*(Back from the Python digression and especially the digression of the
digression):*

Okay, so now you now enough about modules and objects. Let's create a
``note.Note`` object. How about the F at the top of the treble clef
staff:

.. code:: python

    f = note.Note("F5")

We use the convention where middle-C is C4, the octave above it is C5,
etc.

Now you have a Note. Where is it? It's stored in the variable ``f``. You
can verify this just by typing ``f``:

.. code:: python

    f


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note F>


And you can see that it's actually an F and actually in octave 5 by
requesting the ``.name`` and ``.octave`` attributes on the ``Note``
object, ``f``:

.. code:: python

    f.name


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'F'


.. code:: python

    f.octave


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    5


Well, that didn't tell you anything you didn't know already! Let's look
at some other attributes that might tell you something you didn't know:

.. code:: python

    f.frequency


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    698.456462866008


.. code:: python

    f.pitchClassString


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    '5'


That's a bit better! So an f is about 698hz (if A4 = 440hz), and it is
pitch class 5 (where C = 0, C# and Db = 1, etc.).

A couple of things that you'll notice:

1. Your ``frequency`` probably has a bunch more numbers instead of
   ending with "...". Mine gives me "698.456462866008". In the docs,
   we'll sometimes write "..." instead of putting in all those numbers
   (or long strings); it's partly a way of saving space, and also
   because the length of a long number and even the last few digits will
   differ from computer to computer depending on whether it's 32-bit or
   64-bit, Mac or PC, number of sunspots last Autumn, etc. Since I don't
   know what computer you're using, don't worry if you get slightly
   different results.


2. There are single quotes around some of the output (like the ``'F'``
   in ``f.name``) and none around others (like the ``5`` in
   ``f.octave``). The quotes mean that that attribute is returning a
   String (a bunch of letters or numbers or simple symbols). The lack of
   quotes means that it's returning a number (either an integer or if
   there's a decimal point, a sneakingly decimal-like thingy called a
   ``float`` (or "floating-point number") which looks and acts just like
   a decimal, except when it doesn't, which is never when you'd expect.


*(The history and theory behind* ``floats`` *will be explained to you at
length by any computer scientist, usually when he or she is the only
thing standing between you and the bar at a party. Really, we shouldn't
be using them anymore, except for the fact that for our computers
they're so much faster to work with than decimals.)*

The difference between the string ``'5'`` and the number ``5`` is
essential to keep in mind. In Python (like most modern programming
languages) we use two equal signs (``==``) to ask if two things are
equal. So:

.. code:: python

    f.octave == 5


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True


That's what we'd expect. But try:

.. code:: python

    f.pitchClassString == 5


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    False


That's because ``5 == '5'`` is ``False``. (There are some lovely
languages such as JavaScript and Perl where it's ``True``; Python's not
one of them. This has many disadvantages at first, but as you go on, you
might see this as an advantage). So to see if ``f.pitchClassString`` is
``'5'`` we need to make ``'5'`` a string by putting it in quotes:

.. code:: python

    f.pitchClassString == "5"


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True


In Python it doesn't matter if you put the ``5`` in single or double
quotes:

.. code:: python

    f.pitchClassString == '5'


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    True


``pitchClassString`` tells you that you should expect a string, because
we've put it in the name. There's also a ``.pitchClass`` which returns a
number:

.. code:: python

    f.pitchClass


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    5


These two ways of getting a pitch class are basically the same for the
note "F" (except that one's a string and the other is an integer) but
for a B-flat, which is ``.pitchClass`` 10 and ``.pitchClassString`` "A",
it makes a difference.

Let's go ahead and make that B-flat note. In ``music21``, sharps are "#"
as you might expect, but flats are "-". That's because it's otherwise
hard to tell the difference between the ``Note`` "b" (in this instance,
you can write it in upper or lower case) and the symbol "flat". So let's
make that B-flat note:

.. code:: python

    bflat = note.Note("B-2")

I've called the variable "``bflat``\ " here. You could call it
"``Bb``\ " if you want or "``b_flat``\ ", but not "``b-flat``\ " because
dashes aren't allowed in variable names:

.. code:: python

    b-flat = note.Note("B-2")

::

      File "<ipython-input-18-d519b3e88921>", line 1
        b-flat = note.Note("B-2")
    SyntaxError: can't assign to operator

Since this note has an accidental you can get it by using the
``.accidental`` property:

.. code:: python

    bflat.accidental


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <accidental flat>


Here we have something that isn't a number and doesn't have quotes
around it. That usually means that what ``.accidental`` returns is
another object -- in this case an :class:`~music21.pitch.Accidental`
object. As we saw above, objects have attributes (and other goodies
we'll get to in a second) and the ``Accidental`` object is no exception.
So let's make a new variable that will store ``bflat``'s accidental:

.. code:: python

    acc = bflat.accidental

We'll get to all the attributes of ``Accidental`` objects in a bit, but
here are two of them: ``.alter`` and ``.displayLocation``. You'll use
the first one quite a bit: it shows how many semitones this
``Accidental`` changes the ``Note``:

.. code:: python

    acc.alter


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    -1.0


Since this ``Accidental`` is a flat, its ``.alter`` is a negative
number. Notice that it's also not an integer, but a float. That might
indicate that music21 supports things like quarter-tones, and in this
case you'd be right.

Look back at the two lines "``acc = bflat.accidental``\ " and
"``acc.alter``\ ". We set ``acc`` to be the value of ``bflat``'s
``.accidental`` attribute and then we get the value of that variable's
``.alter`` attribute. We could have skipped the first step altogether
and "chained" the two attributes together in one step:

.. code:: python

    bflat.accidental.alter


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    -1.0


.. code:: python

    acc.displayLocation


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'normal'


Good to know that we've set a sensible default. If you want to have the
accidental display above the note, you'll have to set that yourself:

.. code:: python

    acc.displayLocation = 'above'
    acc.displayLocation


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'above'


Our variable ``"acc"`` is the **exact** accidental that is attached to
the B-flat Note stored as ``bflat``. It's not a flat that's similar to
B-flat's flat, but the same one. (in computer-speak, ``acc`` is a
*reference* to ``.accidental``). So now if we look at the
``.displayLocation`` of ``bflat.accidental`` we see that it too is set
to the silly "above" position:

.. code:: python

    bflat.accidental.displayLocation


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'above'


Python is one of those cool computer languages where if an object
doesn't have a particular attribute but you think it should, you can add
it to the object (some people find that this makes objects messy, but I
don't mind it). For what I hope are obvious reasons, the ``Note`` object
does not have an attribute called "``wasWrittenByStockhausen``\ ". So if
you try to access it, you'll get an error:

.. code:: python

    bflat.wasWrittenByStockhausen

::

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-26-3e7bfdcb790a> in <module>()
    ----> 1 bflat.wasWrittenByStockhausen
    
    AttributeError: 'Note' object has no attribute 'wasWrittenByStockhausen'

But if you set the value of that weird attribute, you can use it later:

.. code:: python

    bflat.wasWrittenByStockhausen = True
    f.wasWrittenByStockhausen = False

Then you can write an “if” statement to see if this is True or not:

.. code:: python

    if bflat.wasWrittenByStockhausen == True:
        print("Hope you're enjoying Sirius!")


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    Hope you're enjoying Sirius!

Just as you don’t type the “>>>” at the beginning of the line, don’t
type the ”...” either. But you will need to put the spaces before the
“print” command; Python uses spaces to keep track of what is inside of
an if statement (or lots of other things) and what isn’t.

(If you don’t get the Stockhausen joke, see: wikipedia . )

Nothing will print for the note f since we set .wasWrittenByStockhausen
to False:

.. code:: python

    if f.wasWrittenByStockhausen == True:
        print("I love Helicopters!")

At this point you might be tired of all this programming and just want
to see or play your damn note! If you’ve installed a MusicXML reader
such as MuseScore, Finale, Sibelius, or Finale Notepad, you can type:

.. code:: python

    f.show()


.. image:: usersGuide_02_notes_files/_fig_19.png


and see it. We make the default note length a quarter-note. We'll get to
other note lengths in a minute. Notice that we put in a sensible clef
also, since otherwise you won't know that this note really is ``F5``.

If you want to hear it instead (and you're on Windows or Unix or an
older-Mac (10.5 or older)) type:

.. code:: python

    #_DOCS_SHOW f.show('midi')

Maddeningly, Apple removed MIDI support in the version of QuickTime
(QuickTime X) included in OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and above (including
Mountain Lion), so you'll need to get the older QuickTime 7 from
appleQuicktime to make that work.

When we typed ``f.octave`` we didn't put any parentheses after it, but
when we call ``f.show()`` we always need to put parentheses after it,
even if there's nothing in them (in which case, we'll use the default
``.show`` format, which is usually ``musicxml``).

``.show()`` is what’s called a method on the ``Note`` object, while
``.octave`` is an attribute. Think of methods as like verbs (“O Note:
show thyself!”) while attributes are like adjectives that describe the
object. All methods need to have parentheses after them and inside the
parentheses you can usually put other things (“parameters”) that control
how to perform the action. For instance, let’s create a new note, ``D``
by transposing our B-flat up a major-third (“M3”):

.. code:: python

    d = bflat.transpose("M3")
    d


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note D>


.. code:: python

    bflat


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B->


Instead of changing the original note, the ``transpose()`` method
"returns" (that is, spits out) a new ``note.Note`` object that
represents the operation of transposing it up (or down if you want to
try "-M3") a certain interval.

If you want to change ``bflat`` itself, you can add "inPlace = True" to
the parameters of ``.transpose()`` separating it from the interval by a
comma. Let's take it up a perfect fourth:

.. code:: python

    bflat.transpose("P4", inPlace = True)
    bflat


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note E->


Of course now ``bflat`` is a terrible name for our variable! You could
type "``eflat = bflat``\ " and now you can call the note ``eflat``. But
you'll probably not need to do this too often. By the way, music21
handles some pretty wacky intervals, so if we go back to our variable
``d`` (which is still a ``d`` -- transposing bflat in place didn't
change it; they're not connected anymore, barely on speaking terms
even), let's transpose it up a doubly-diminished sixth:

.. code:: python

    whatNoteIsThis = d.transpose('dd6')
    whatNoteIsThis


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    <music21.note.Note B--->


B-triple-flat! Haven't seen one of those in a while! Let's check that
note's ``.accidental.alter`` and its ``.accidental.name``:

One last thing: not every note has an accidental. The ``d`` for instance
doesn't have one, so it returns ``None``, which is a special value that
puts nothing on the output.

.. code:: python

    d.accidental

If you want to be sure that it is ``None``, you can print the value:

.. code:: python

    print(d.accidental)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    None

Since ``d.accidental`` is ``None`` does this mean that
``d.accidental.name`` is ``None`` too?

.. code:: python

    d.accidental.name

::

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-39-2b6769f305a4> in <module>()
    ----> 1 d.accidental.name
    
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'

Nope! In fact it creates an error (which we'll also call "raising an
Exception" for reasons that will become clear soon). That's because
instead of getting an ``Accidental`` object from ``.accidental`` like we
did before, we got a ``NoneType`` object (i.e., ``None``).
``Accidental`` objects have an attribute called ``name``, but the object
``None`` doesn't (it's like trying ``.wasWrittenByStockhausen`` before
you've defined it as an attribute).

When you're just typing in IDLE or the command line, raising an
Exception is no big deal, but when you're running a program, Exceptions
will usually cause the program to crash (i.e., stop working). So we try
to make sure that our ``Notes`` actually have ``Accidentals`` before we
print the ``.accidental``'s name, and we do that by using another ``if``
statement:

.. code:: python

    if d.accidental is not None:
        print(d.accidental.name)

This way is safer because we will only try to print
``d.accidental.name`` if ``d.accidental`` is not ``None``. Since it *is*
``None`` in this case, Python will never try the second line (which
would otherwise cause it to crash).

This might be a good place to take a rest for a second. So make a
``Rest``:

.. code:: python

    r = note.Rest()

Be sure to put the "()" (double parentheses) signs after ``note.Rest``
otherwise strange things will happen (technically you get a reference to
the class ``note.Rest``, which will come in handy in about 10 chapters,
but not right now).

You can ``.show()`` it as a '``musicxml``\ ' file of course...

.. code:: python

    r.show()


.. image:: usersGuide_02_notes_files/_fig_26.png


...but if you try to hear it as a '``midi``\ ' file, don't expect to be
overwhelmed.

One last thing: notice that we never used a variable name called
"``note``\ " to store a ``note.Note`` object. **Don't do this**. If you
type something like this (don't type this if you want to continue typing
along with the user guide):

.. code:: python

    #_DOCS_SHOW note = note.Note("C#3")

Well now you're in a bind. You've got your ``Note`` object stored as
``note``, but we *need* the ``note`` *module* in order to create new
``Note`` objects and now you have no way of getting it. (this is the
problem that "polluting the namespace" causes that your Python guru
friend might have warned you about). So unless you're Emperor Leopold of
Austria who complained that there were "too many notes," you're probably
going to want to make more ``note.Note`` objects in the future, so don't
use ``note`` as a variable name. (The same goes with ``pitch``,
``scale``, ``key``, ``clef``, and so on. You'll see me use variable
names like ``myNote`` and ``myClef`` to avoid the problem).

Okay, now you have the basics of ``Note`` objects down, let's go on to
the next chapter:
:ref:`Pitches and Durations <usersGuide_03_pitches>`.

User's Guide, Chapter 10: File Formats (1)
==========================================

Music21 can import and export a variety of musical data formats. Many
examples of these formats are distributed with music21 as part of the
corpus module (see :ref:`moduleCorpus`).

The converter module, as well as the module function
:func:`music21.converter.parse` handle importing all supported
formats. For complete documentation on file and data formats, see
:ref:`moduleConverter`.

Parsing MusicXML Files
======================

We can parse a MusicXML file by providing the
:func:`music21.converter.parse` function with a local file path or an
URL to a file path. The function will determine the file format. An
appropriate :class:`~music21.stream.Stream` or Stream subclass will be
returned. For example, given a MusicXML file stored at the file path
"/Users/cuthbert/\_scratch/bwv1007-01.xml", a Stream can be created from
the file with the following.

.. code:: python

    from music21 import *
    #_DOCS_SHOW c = converter.parse('/Users/cuthbert/Desktop/myXML.xml')

Alternative, we can provide a URL to the
:func:`music21.converter.parse` function that points to the desired
file. Assuming proper system configuration (see :ref:`environment`),
the file will be downloaded and parsed.

.. code:: python

    url = 'http://kern.ccarh.org/cgi-bin/ksdata?l=cc/bach/cello&file=bwv1007-01.krn&f=xml'
    sAlt = converter.parse(url)
    sAlt[1][:6].show() # show first 5 measures

Note that presently music21 offers limited support for compressed .mxl
MusicXML files; this feature will be expanded in the future.

Getting MusicXML Files
======================

Numerous MusicXML files can be found at the following URLs.

http://kern.ccarh.org http://www.gutenberg.org

Parsing Humdrum Files
=====================

Parsing Humdrum files is exactly as parsing other data formats. Simply
call the music21.converter.parse() function on the desired file path or
URL.

.. code:: python

    sBach = converter.parse('http://kern.ccarh.org/cgi-bin/ksdata?l=users/craig/classical/bach/cello&file=bwv1007-01.krn&f=kern') 

Getting Humdrum Files
=====================

Over one hundred thousand Kern files can be found at the following URL.

Parsing ABC Files
=================

Parsing ABC files is exactly as parsing other data formats. Simply call
the :func:`music21.converter.parse` function on the desired file path
or URL.

.. code:: python

    #_DOCS_SHOW o = converter.parse('/Users/cuthbert/Documents/Music21/praludium.abc')

Note that many ABC files define more than one complete musical work. If
an ABC file defines more than one work, an
:class:`~music21.stream.Opus` object is returned. Opus objects, a
Stream subclass, provide convenience methods for accessing multiple
Score objects.

Reference work numbers (e.g., the "X:" metadata tag in ABC) are stored
in :class:`~music21.metadata.Metadata` objects in each contained
Score. Access to these numbers from the Opus is available with the
:meth:`music21.stream.Opus.getNumbers` method. Additionally, the
:class:`~music21.stream.Score` object can be directly obtained with
the :meth:`~music21.stream.Opus.getScoreByNumber` method.

.. code:: python

    o = corpus.parse('josquin/ovenusbant')
    o.getNumbers()




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    ['1', '2', '3']



.. code:: python

    s = o.getScoreByNumber(2)
    s.metadata.title




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'O Venus bant'



Direct access to Score objects contained in an Opus by title is
available with the :meth:`~music21.stream.Opus.getScoreByTitle`
method.

.. code:: python

    o = corpus.parse('essenFolksong/erk5')
    s = o.getScoreByTitle('Vrienden, kommt alle gaere')

In some cases an ABC file may define individual parts each as a separate
score. When parsed, these parts can be combined from the Opus into a
single Score with the :meth:`music21.stream.Opus.mergeScores` method.

.. code:: python

    o = corpus.parse('josquin/milleRegrets')
    s = o.mergeScores()
    s.metadata.title




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    'Mille regrets'



.. code:: python

    len(s.parts)




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

Getting ABC Files
=================

Large collections of ABC are available from numerous on-line
repositories. The following links are just a few of the many resources
available.

Parsing Musedata Files
======================

Both stage 1 and stage 2 Musedata file formats are supported by Music21.
Multi-part Musedata (stage 2) files, zipped archives, and directories
containing individual files for each part (stage 1 or stage 2) can be
imported with the :func:`music21.converter.parse` function on the
desired file path or URL.

Note that access restrictions prevent demonstrating Musedata conversion.

Parsing MIDI Files
==================

MIDI input and output is handled in the same was other formats. Simply
call the :func:`music21.converter.parse` function on the desired file
path or URL.

The inner objects, measures, clefs, notes, etc. Will not be available.  The simplest way of getting at all these objects is with the ``Stream.flat`` property.  Calling it on this score will change the representation so that only the non-stream elements (the pink ovals) remain in the score:"

The relationship between the two is called a ``Derivation``.  Symbolically, this representation can be visualized as follows:"

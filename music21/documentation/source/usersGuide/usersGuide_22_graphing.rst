Userâ€™s Guide, Chapter 22: Graphing
==================================


There are a number of ways to visualize notes, scores, and measures in
music21.

Visualizing Streams in Plots
----------------------------

While the :meth:`~music21.base.Music21Object.show` method provides
common musical views of a Stream, a visual plot a Stream's elements is
very useful. Sometimes called a piano roll, we might graph the pitch of
a Note over its position in a Measure (or offset if no Measures are
defined). The :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.plot` method permits us to
create a plot of any Stream or Stream subclass (note that the additional
package matplotlib needs to be installed to run graphs, see
:ref:`installAdditional` for more information). There are a large
variety of plots: see :ref:`moduleGraph` for a complete list. There
are a number of ways to get the desired plot; one, as demonstrated
below, is to provide the name of the plot as a string. We can also add a
keyword argument for the title of the plot (and configure many other
features).

.. code:: python

    from music21 import *
    sBach = corpus.parse('bach/bwv57.8')
    sBach.getElementById('Soprano').plot('PlotHorizontalBarPitchSpaceOffset', title='Soprano')

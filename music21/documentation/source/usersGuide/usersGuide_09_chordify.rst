User's Guide: Chapter 9: Chordify
=================================


Chordify is a powerful tool for reducing a complex score with multiple
parts to a succession of chords in one part that represent everything
that is happening in the score. Take this short chorale by Bach:

.. code:: python


.. code:: python

    from music21 import *
    
    b = corpus.parse('bwv66.6')
    b.show()


.. image:: usersGuide_09_chordify_files/_fig_01.png


Let's take it and chordify it using the
:meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.chordify` method.

.. code:: python

    bChords = b.chordify()

Now we can see if there are any (fully-notated) dominant seventh chords
in the piece. The new chordified part still has measures, so we'll
flatten the chordified part first to get to the chords. It might also
have time signatures, etc., so we will filter them out so we only have
chords.

.. code:: python

    for thisChord in bChords.flat:
        if 'Chord' not in thisChord.classes: # not a chord
            continue
        if thisChord.isDominantSeventh():
            print thisChord.measureNumber, thisChord.beatStr, thisChord


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    2 2 1/2 <music21.chord.Chord B4 G#4 D4 E3>
    3 2 1/2 <music21.chord.Chord G#4 E#4 B3 C#3>
    4 3 1/2 <music21.chord.Chord F#4 D#4 A3 B2>
    8 2 <music21.chord.Chord F#4 E4 C#4 A#2>

Sure enough we can check the score above and see that there are four of
them: three of them on the offbeat (m.2 beat 2.5, m. 3 beat 2.5, and m.
4 beat 3.5) which are made from passing motion, and one of them in m. 8
beat 2 also in a metrically weak position.

We can see the chordified version by callling ".show()" on ``bChords``
itself, but it's probably better to see it in the context of the whole
score. Let's put it in the score at the beginning (all ``Part`` objects
should go at the beginning) and then show just measures 0 (pickup) to 4:

.. code:: python

    b.insert(0, bChords)
    b.measures(0, 4).show()


.. image:: usersGuide_09_chordify_files/_fig_04.png


That's a bit messy to read, so let's put all these chords in
``closedPosition`` (see :ref:`usersGuide_07_chords` for more
information).

.. code:: python

    for c in bChords.flat:
        if 'Chord' not in c.classes:
            continue
        c.closedPosition(forceOctave=4, inPlace=True)
    
    b.measures(0,2).show()


.. image:: usersGuide_09_chordify_files/_fig_06.png


We can use the function ``roman.romanNumeralFromChord`` to label each of
the chordified Chords:

.. code:: python

    for c in bChords.flat.getElementsByClass('Chord'):
        rn = roman.romanNumeralFromChord(c, key.Key('A'))
        c.addLyric(str(rn.figure))

.. code:: python

    b.measures(0, 2).show()


.. image:: usersGuide_09_chordify_files/_fig_08.png


We can also see everything directly if we look at the ``.show('text')``
output:

.. code:: python

    bChords.measures(0,2).show('text')


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 0 offset=0.0>
        {0.0} <music21.clef.TrebleClef>
        {0.0} <music21.key.KeySignature of 3 sharps, mode minor>
        {0.0} <music21.meter.TimeSignature 4/4>
        {0.0} <music21.chord.Chord A4 C#5 E5>
        {0.5} <music21.chord.Chord G#4 B4 E5>
    {1.0} <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=1.0>
        {0.0} <music21.chord.Chord F#4 A4 C#5>
        {1.0} <music21.chord.Chord G#4 B4 E5>
        {2.0} <music21.chord.Chord A4 C#5 E5>
        {3.0} <music21.chord.Chord G#4 B4 E5>
    {5.0} <music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=5.0>
        {0.0} <music21.chord.Chord A4 C#5 E5>
        {0.5} <music21.chord.Chord C#4 E4 A4>
        {1.0} <music21.chord.Chord E4 G#4 B4>
        {1.5} <music21.chord.Chord E4 G#4 B4 D5>
        {2.0} <music21.chord.Chord A4 C#5 E5>
        {3.0} <music21.chord.Chord E#4 G#4 C#5>

We can also just extract the lyrics, where we stored the RomanNumeral
information:

.. code:: python

    for c in bChords.measures(0,2).flat:
        if 'Chord' not in c.classes:
            continue
        print c.lyric,


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: ipython-result

    I V6 vi V6 I V6 I I6 V V7 I III6

There are more specialized commands for ``.chordify``, so if you want to
learn more, look at the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.chordify`
documentation. We will get to the option, ``addPartNameAsGroup`` later,
which will let you know exactly where each pitch in the chordified Chord
comes from. But for now, let's jump to
:ref:`usersGuide_10_fileFormats`

      "If you're going to use `music21`, you'll need to have a copy of it and Python on your computer.  The instructions are slightly different for each type of computer, so follow the link below and then come back to the system.  For many people, installation is the most difficult step for a bit.\n",

      "If you want to see if it's worth installing, keep :ref:`reading the guide <usersGuide_02_notes>` without installing, but if you have installed already, you'll get more out of the guide since you'll be able to follow along.\n",

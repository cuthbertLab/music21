    Note
        A notated music event. See :ref:`usersGuide_02_notes` or :ref:`moduleNote`.

    Pitch
        A representation of fundamental frequency. See :ref:`usersGuide_03_pitches` or :ref:`modulePitch`.

    Stream
        A music21 object for containing objects. See :ref:`overviewStreams` or :ref:`moduleStream`.

    trecento
        The 14th century in the Italian, which is odd because it means 300, but it's short for
        the 1300s.  The creator of music21 works on Italian trecento music, so you'll see a lot
        of references to it here.

    Measure
        A type of Stream. See :ref:`moduleStream`.

    Spanner
        An object that connects multiple objects in various Streams.  Spanners include
        things like Slurs and Glissandos and also StaffGroups (which links Part objects
        that should have brackets around them).

Applications and Extensions of music21
=============================================

Music21 has been used in numerous research tasks already, and will continue to offer researchers many tools with which to explore new domains.

Future Goals and Potential Applications
---------------------------------------------------

There are numerous applications for music21 that we anticipate, yet simply have not had time to implement. Consider taking on one of these projects, or write us with new and interesting suggestions. To contact the authors, visit :ref:`about`.

- Piano-key-visualization

- Braille music notation conversion

- Slonimsky scale types

- Automatic clarinet fingering generation via ClarFinger font (link: www.trecento.com/fonts/)

- Automatic string fingerings. 

- Indian Raga encoding: including ascending, descending, and typical presentations, microtonal inflections, common associations, historical context.

- Conversion of mensural notation to common-music-notation.

- Multiple-simultaneous-tempi to a single tempo conversion (via tuplets).

- Palestrina counterpoint generation (via algorithms of Mary Farbood and others.).

- GIS integration (after the work by Bret Aarden).

- Beneventan chant similarity indices (thanks to the work of Thomas Forrest Kelly and the Exultet encodings made available in `**kern` by Elsa De Luca).

- Humdrum export (we don't want our interaction with Humdrum to be a one-way street! We just haven't had time to put this in yet).

- Identify staff line of a note given its Clef-context.

- Identify potential clefs for fragmentary Renaissance and Medieval pieces that are missing their clefs. (Use their staff-lines and minimizing number of melodic and harmonic tritones).

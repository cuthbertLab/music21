Music21 is unthinkable without our colleagues and friends
working on other music and technology projects, in particular:

* `David Huron`_, inventor of `Humdrum`_, the inspiration for music21.

* The `Center for Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities`_ at Stanford University,
  contributing to the knowledge of music since 1984, and

   support and for their contributions to the open source music notation projects, 
   including the Bach Goldberg Variations and the Handel Arias included.

* `Donald Byrd`_, researcher on University of Indiana who created 
   a schema for computer-aided musicology (along with the source of all sorts of 
   examples of how music notation is difficult).

* `Jack Campin`_ has kindly given permission to distribute his ABC editions of the Aird 
  Collection, the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, and the Colonial and Civil War American

   collection of the Bach chorales in MusicXML format as part of the music21 corpus.  
   Her website contains all these chorales in additional formats.

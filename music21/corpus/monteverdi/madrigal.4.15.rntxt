Composer: Claudio Monteverdi
Madrigal: 4.15
Title: Non piu guerra, pietate
Analyst: Noam D. Elkies
Time Signature: 4/4
Key Signature: Bb

Note: A basic harmonic figure in this madrigal is a series of root-position chords moving by thirds, linked by their common duads (and thus avoiding flagrant parallel fifths).  Often the new note is introduced as an upbeat; then a "var" harmony is indicated to allow the new chord to start on the upbeat or the next downbeat.
m1 F: I
m3 b3 vi
m3var1 b2 vi
m4 b3 IV
m4var1 b2 IV
Note: the D in 6.4 may be heard as ornaments even though they're not in stepwise motion.  cf. 10 and 17 where no chord change is indicated even as a "var" because the motif is ornamental in other voices (though it feels functional in 25).

Note: in 27var1 and 28var1 the iii and vi chords could be heard as nonfunctional chords formed by accented passing notes in the bass.

Note: rather unusually the first 2/3 of the madrigal is basically in one key

Note: I keep the key at F from here to the end.  62-65 feints at C but uses v/C instead of the expected V/C to turns back to F.

Note: the "bVII6/5 chord" is a suspension + accented leading tone of the following v6/4, but it does last a full half note.
m64 v6/4
m64var1 bVII6/5 b3: v6/4
Note: 4-3 suspension in half notes, so we expect it to resolve to V/V
m65 ii
m66 V7 b3 I6/4
m67 b3 V
Note: cf. m64var1 with m68var1.  Here the "6/5 chord" lasts even longer, and the E is not passing but a leap down from C (with a rest in beat 1)

Note: normally I wouldn't bother with m72var1, but see the note before m1

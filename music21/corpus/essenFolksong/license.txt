The legal status of the Essen folksong database is unclear, as the data has been input by many people.

Original encoding was completed under the supervision of Helmut Schaffrath.

The project was taken over by Prof. AMU Dr. Habil. Ewa Dahlig-Turek, who has given permission 
for non-commercial distribution and use of these files in music21. 

Information on the original EsAC encodings can be found here:
http://www.esac-data.org

The files distributed with music21 are ABC encodings, created by Seymour Schlien, and 
distributed with music21 by his permission. 

The original ABC files can be found here:

We thank both of these scholars for their generous contribution to this project.

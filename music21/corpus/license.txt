The BSD licensed music21 software is distributed with a corpus of encoded compositions 
which are distributed with the permission of the encoders (and, where needed, the 
composers or arrangers) and where permitted under United States copyright law. 
Some encodings included in the corpus may not be used for commercial uses or have 
other restrictions: please see the licenses embedded in individual compositions or 
directories for more details.   

You may have been provided a copy of music21 with the corpus removed for distribution
or copyright reasons. If so, you will be asked if you wish to download the corpus upon
first use of the software. If you decide to do so, you are acknowledging that the
corpus is legally allowed to be used in your jurisdiction and that you agree to
use it within the bounds of the license for each individual composition or repertory.

To the best of our knowledge, the each piece of music in the corpus is 
either out of copyright in the United States or is licensed for use, though there may be
restrictions on commercial use.
The encodings may be under copyright but have been licensed for use, though there may be
restrictions on commercial use.
These works, along with any works linked to in the virtual corpus, may or may not be 
free in your jurisdiction. If you believe this message to be in error regarding one 
or more works please contact Michael Scott Cuthbert at the address provided on the contact page.

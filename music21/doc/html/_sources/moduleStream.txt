Stream
------

.. class:: Stream(givenElements=None)

    This is the fundamental container for Music21Objects; objects may be ordered and/or placed in time based on offsets from the start of this container's offset. Like the base class, Music21Object, Streams have offsets, priority, id, and groups they also have an elements attribute which returns a list of elements; The Stream has a duration that is usually the release time of the chronologically last element in the Stream (that is, the highest onset plus duration of any element in the Stream). However, it can either explicitly set in which case we say that the duration is unlinked Streams may be embedded within other Streams.

    **Stream** **attributes**

        .. attribute:: flattenedRepresentationOf

            When this flat Stream is derived from another non-flat stream, a reference to the source Stream is stored here. 

        .. attribute:: isFlat

            Boolean describing whether the Stream is flat. 

        .. attribute:: isSorted

            Boolean describing whether the Stream is sorted or not. 

        Attributes without Documentation: `classNames`

        Attributes inherited from :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object`: :attr:`~music21.base.Music21Object.id`, :attr:`~music21.base.Music21Object.groups`

    **Stream** **properties**

        .. attribute:: measures

            Return all :class:`~music21.stream.Measure` objects in a Stream() 

        .. attribute:: notes

            The notes property of a Stream returns a new Stream object that consists only of the notes (including :class:`~music21.note.Note`, :class:`~music21.chord.Chord`, :class:`~music21.note.Rest`, etc.) found in the stream. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> s1 = Stream()
            >>> k1 = key.KeySignature(0) # key of C
            >>> n1 = note.Note('B')
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['A', 'B-'])
            >>> s1.append([k1, n1, c1])
            >>> s1.show('text')
            {0.0} <music21.key.KeySignature of no sharps or flats> 
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note B> 
            {1.0} <music21.chord.Chord A B-> 
            >>> notes1 = s1.notes
            >>> notes1.show('text')
            {0.0} <music21.note.Note B> 
            {1.0} <music21.chord.Chord A B-> 

        .. attribute:: pitches

            Return all :class:`~music21.pitch.Pitch` objects found in any element in the Stream as a Python List. Elements such as Streams, and Chords will have their Pitch objects accumulated as well. For that reason, a flat representation may not be required. Pitch objects are returned in a List, not a Stream.  This usage differs from the notes property, but makes sense since Pitch objects are usually durationless.  (That's the main difference between them and notes) 

            >>> from music21 import corpus
            >>> a = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv324.xml')
            >>> voiceOnePitches = a[0].pitches
            >>> len(voiceOnePitches)
            25 
            >>> voiceOnePitches[0:10]
            [B4, D5, B4, B4, B4, B4, C5, B4, A4, A4] 
            Note that the pitches returned above are 
            objects, not text: 
            >>> voiceOnePitches[0].octave
            4 
            Since pitches are found from internal objects, 
            flattening the stream is not required: 
            >>> len(a.pitches)
            104 
            Pitch objects are also retrieved when stored directly on a Stream. 
            >>> from music21 import pitch
            >>> pitch1 = pitch.Pitch()
            >>> st1 = Stream()
            >>> st1.append(pitch1)
            >>> foundPitches = st1.pitches
            >>> len(foundPitches)
            1 
            >>> foundPitches[0] is pitch1
            True 

        .. attribute:: duration

            Returns the total duration of the Stream, from the beginning of the stream until the end of the final element. May be set independently by supplying a Duration object. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> q = note.QuarterNote()
            >>> a.repeatInsert(q, [0,1,2,3])
            >>> a.highestOffset
            3.0 
            >>> a.highestTime
            4.0 
            >>> a.duration.quarterLength
            4.0 
            >>> # Advanced usage: overriding the duration
            >>> newDuration = duration.Duration("half")
            >>> newDuration.quarterLength
            2.0 
            >>> a.duration = newDuration
            >>> a.duration.quarterLength
            2.0 
            >>> a.highestTime # unchanged
            4.0 

        .. attribute:: elements

            The low-level storage list of all Streams. Directly getting, setting, and manipulating this list is reserved for advanced usage. 

        .. attribute:: flat

            Return a new Stream that has all sub-container flattened within. 

        .. attribute:: highestOffset

            Get start time of element with the highest offset in the Stream. Note the difference between this property and highestTime which gets the end time of the highestOffset 

            >>> stream1 = Stream()
            >>> for offset in [0, 4, 8]:
            ...     n = note.WholeNote('G#') 
            ...     stream1.insert(offset, n) 
            >>> stream1.highestOffset
            8.0 
            >>> stream1.highestTime
            12.0 

        .. attribute:: highestTime

            Returns the maximum of all Element offsets plus their Duration in quarter lengths. This value usually represents the last "release" in the Stream. The duration of a Stream is usually equal to the highestTime expressed as a Duration object, but can be set separately. 

        .. attribute:: isGapless

            No documentation. 

        .. attribute:: lily

            Returns the stream translated into Lilypond format. 

        .. attribute:: lowestOffset

            Get the start time of the Element with the lowest offset in the Stream. 

            >>> stream1 = Stream()
            >>> for x in range(3,5):
            ...     n = note.Note('G#') 
            ...     stream1.insert(x, n) 
            ... 
            >>> stream1.lowestOffset
            3.0 

            
            If the Stream is empty, then the lowest offset is 0.0: 

            
            >>> stream2 = Stream()
            >>> stream2.lowestOffset
            0.0 

            

            

        .. attribute:: musicxml

            Return a complete MusicXML reprsentatoin as a string. 

        .. attribute:: mx

            Create and return a musicxml score. 

            >>> n1 = note.Note()
            >>> measure1 = Measure()
            >>> measure1.insert(n1)
            >>> str1 = Stream()
            >>> str1.insert(measure1)
            >>> mxScore = str1.mx

        .. attribute:: semiFlat

            Returns a flat-like Stream representation. Stream sub-classed containers, such as Measure or Part, are retained in the output Stream, but positioned at their relative offset. 

        .. attribute:: sorted

            returns a new Stream where all the elements are sorted according to offset time if this stream is not flat, then only the highest elements are sorted.  To sort all, run myStream.flat.sorted 

            >>> s = Stream()
            >>> s.repeatInsert(note.Note("C#"), [0, 2, 4])
            >>> s.repeatInsert(note.Note("D-"), [1, 3, 5])
            >>> s.isSorted
            False 
            >>> g = ""
            >>> for myElement in s:

            >>> g
            '0.0: C#; 2.0: C#; 4.0: C#; 1.0: D-; 3.0: D-; 5.0: D-; '

            >>> farRight.priority = 5
            >>> farRight.offset = 2.0
            >>> y.insert(farRight)
            >>> g = ""

    **Stream** **methods**

        .. method:: append(others)

            Add Music21Objects (including other Streams) to the Stream (or multiple if passed a list) with offset equal to the highestTime (that is the latest "release" of an object), that is, directly after the last element ends. if the objects are not Music21Objects, they are wrapped in ElementWrappers runs fast for multiple addition and will preserve isSorted if True 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> notes = []
            >>> for x in range(0,3):
            ...     n = note.Note('G#') 
            ...     n.duration.quarterLength = 3 
            ...     notes.append(n) 
            >>> a.append(notes[0])
            >>> a.highestOffset, a.highestTime
            (0.0, 3.0) 
            >>> a.append(notes[1])
            >>> a.highestOffset, a.highestTime
            (3.0, 6.0) 
            >>> a.append(notes[2])
            >>> a.highestOffset, a.highestTime
            (6.0, 9.0) 
            >>> notes2 = []
            >>> # since notes are not embedded in Elements here, their offset
            >>> # changes when added to a stream!
            >>> for x in range(0,3):
            ...     n = note.Note("A-") 
            ...     n.duration.quarterLength = 3 
            ...     n.offset = 0 
            ...     notes2.append(n) 
            >>> a.append(notes2) # add em all again
            >>> a.highestOffset, a.highestTime
            (15.0, 18.0) 
            >>> a.isSequence()
            True 
            Add a note that already has an offset set -- does nothing different! 
            >>> n3 = note.Note("B-")
            >>> n3.offset = 1
            >>> n3.duration.quarterLength = 3
            >>> a.append(n3)
            >>> a.highestOffset, a.highestTime
            (18.0, 21.0) 

            

        .. method:: insert(offsetOrItemOrList, itemOrNone=None, ignoreSort=False)

            Inserts an item(s) at the given offset(s).  if ignoreSort is True then the inserting does not change whether the stream is sorted or not (much faster if you're going to be inserting dozens of items that don't change the sort status) Has three forms: in the two argument form, inserts an element at the given offset: 

            >>> st1 = Stream()
            >>> st1.insert(32, note.Note("B-"))
            >>> st1._getHighestOffset()
            32.0 
            In the single argument form with an object, inserts the element at its stored offset: 
            >>> n1 = note.Note("C#")
            >>> n1.offset = 30.0
            >>> st1 = Stream()
            >>> st1.insert(n1)
            >>> st2 = Stream()
            >>> st2.insert(40.0, n1)
            >>> n1.getOffsetBySite(st1)
            30.0 
            In single argument form list a list of alternating offsets and items, inserts the items 
            at the specified offsets: 
            >>> n1 = note.Note("G")
            >>> n2 = note.Note("F#")
            >>> st3 = Stream()
            >>> st3.insert([1.0, n1, 2.0, n2])
            >>> n1.getOffsetBySite(st3)
            1.0 
            >>> n2.getOffsetBySite(st3)
            2.0 
            >>> len(st3)
            2 
            Raise an error if offset is not a number 
            >>> Stream().insert("l","g")
            Traceback (most recent call last): 
            StreamException: ... 

            

        .. method:: addGroupForElements(group, classFilter=None)

            Add the group to the groups attribute of all elements. if classFilter is set then only those elements whose objects belong to a certain class (or for Streams which are themselves of a certain class) are set. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> a.repeatAppend(note.Note('A-'), 30)
            >>> a.repeatAppend(note.Rest(), 30)
            >>> a.addGroupForElements('flute')
            >>> a[0].groups
            ['flute'] 
            >>> a.addGroupForElements('quietTime', note.Rest)
            >>> a[0].groups
            ['flute'] 
            >>> a[50].groups
            ['flute', 'quietTime'] 
            >>> a[1].groups.append('quietTime') # set one note to it
            >>> a[1].step = "B"
            >>> b = a.getElementsByGroup('quietTime')
            >>> len(b)
            31 
            >>> c = b.getElementsByClass(note.Note)
            >>> len(c)
            1 
            >>> c[0].name
            'B-' 

            

        .. method:: allPlayingWhileSounding(el, elStream=None, requireClass=False)

            Returns a new Stream of elements in this stream that sound at the same time as "el", an element presumably in another Stream. The offset of this new Stream is set to el's offset, while the offset of elements within the Stream are adjusted relative to their position with respect to the start of el.  Thus, a note that is sounding already when el begins would have a negative offset.  The duration of otherStream is forced to be the length of el -- thus a note sustained after el ends may have a release time beyond that of the duration of the Stream. as above, elStream is an optional Stream to look up el's offset in. 

            

        .. method:: attachIntervalsBetweenStreams(cmpStream)

            For each element in self, creates an interval object in the element's editorial that is the interval between it and the element in cmpStream that is sounding at the moment the element in srcStream is attacked. 

        .. method:: attributeCount(classFilterList, attrName=quarterLength)

            Return a dictionary of attribute usage for one or more classes provided in a the `classFilterList` list and having the attribute specified by `attrName`. 

            >>> from music21 import corpus
            >>> a = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv324.xml')
            >>> a[0].flat.attributeCount(note.Note, 'quarterLength')
            {1.0: 12, 2.0: 11, 4.0: 2} 

        .. method:: augmentOrDiminish(scalar, inPlace=False)

            Scale this Stream by a provided scalar. 

        .. method:: bestClef(allowTreble8vb=False)

            Returns the clef that is the best fit for notes and chords found in thisStream. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> for x in range(30):
            ...    n = note.Note() 
            ...    n.midi = random.choice(range(60,72)) 
            ...    a.insert(n) 
            >>> b = a.bestClef()
            >>> b.line
            2 
            >>> b.sign
            'G' 
            >>> c = Stream()
            >>> for x in range(30):
            ...    n = note.Note() 
            ...    n.midi = random.choice(range(35,55)) 
            ...    c.insert(n) 
            >>> d = c.bestClef()
            >>> d.line
            4 
            >>> d.sign
            'F' 

        .. method:: extendDuration(objName, inPlace=True)

            Given a Stream and an object class name, go through the Stream and find each instance of the desired object. The time between adjacent objects is then assigned to the duration of each object. The last duration of the last object is assigned to extend to the end of the Stream. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy.

        .. method:: findConsecutiveNotes(skipRests=False, skipChords=False, skipUnisons=False, skipOctaves=False, skipGaps=False, getOverlaps=False, noNone=False, **keywords)

            Returns a list of consecutive *pitched* Notes in a Stream.  A single "None" is placed in the list at any point there is a discontinuity (such as if there is a rest between two pitches). 

            How to determine consecutive pitches is a little tricky and there are many options. skipUnison uses the midi-note value (.ps) to determine unisons, so enharmonic transitions (F# -> Gb) are also skipped if skipUnisons is true.  We believe that this is the most common usage.  However, because of this, you cannot completely be sure that the x.findConsecutiveNotes() - x.findConsecutiveNotes(skipUnisons = True) will give you the number of P1s in the piece, because there could be d2's in there as well. See Test.testFindConsecutiveNotes() for usage details. 

            

        .. method:: findGaps()

            returns either (1) a Stream containing Elements (that wrap the None object) whose offsets and durations are the length of gaps in the Stream or (2) None if there are no gaps. N.B. there may be gaps in the flattened representation of the stream but not in the unflattened.  Hence why "isSequence" calls self.flat.isGapless

        .. method:: getElementsByOffset(offsetStart, offsetEnd=None, includeEndBoundary=True, mustFinishInSpan=False, mustBeginInSpan=True)

            Return a Stream of all Elements that are found at a certain offset or within a certain offset time range, specified as start and stop values. If mustFinishInSpan is True than an event that begins between offsetStart and offsetEnd but which ends after offsetEnd will not be included.  For instance, a half note at offset 2.0 will be found in. The includeEndBoundary option determines if an element begun just at offsetEnd should be included.  Setting includeEndBoundary to False at the same time as mustFinishInSpan is set to True is probably NOT what you ever want to do. Setting mustBeginInSpan to False is a good way of finding

            Find any elements that overlap. Overlaping might include elements that have no duration but that are simultaneous. Whether elements with None durations are included is determined by includeDurationless. CHRIS: What does this return? and how can someone use this? This example demonstrates end-joing overlaps: there are four quarter notes each following each other. Whether or not these count as overlaps is determined by the includeEndBoundary parameter.

            True 

        .. method:: groupCount()

            Get a dictionary for each groupId and the count of instances. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> a.repeatAppend(n, 30)
            >>> a.addGroupForElements('P1')
            >>> a.groupCount()
            {'P1': 30} 
            >>> a[12].groups.append('green')
            >>> a.groupCount()
            {'P1': 30, 'green': 1} 

        .. method:: groupElementsByOffset(returnDict=False)

            returns a List of lists in which each entry in the main list is a list of elements occurring at the same time. list is ordered by offset (since we need to sort the list anyhow in order to group the elements), so there is no need to call stream.sorted before running this, but it can't hurt. it is DEFINITELY a feature that this method does not find elements within substreams that have the same absolute offset.  See Score.lily for how this is useful.  For the other behavior, call Stream.flat first. 

        .. method:: index(obj)

            Return the first matched index for the specified object. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> fSharp = note.Note("F#")
            >>> a.repeatInsert(note.Note("A#"), range(10))
            >>> a.append(fSharp)
            >>> a.index(fSharp)
            10 

        .. method:: indexList(obj, firstMatchOnly=False)

            Return a list of one or more index values where the supplied object is found on this Stream's `elements` list. To just return the first matched index, set `firstMatchOnly` to True. No matches are found, an empty list is returned. 

            >>> s = Stream()
            >>> n1 = note.Note('g')
            >>> n2 = note.Note('g#')
            >>> s.insert(0, n1)
            >>> s.insert(5, n2)
            >>> len(s)
            2 
            >>> s.indexList(n1)
            [0] 
            >>> s.indexList(n2)
            [1] 

            

        .. method:: insertAtNativeOffset(item)

            inserts the item at the offset that was defined before the item was inserted into a stream (that is item.getOffsetBySite(None); in fact, the entire code is self.insert(item.getOffsetBySite(None), item) 

            >>> n1 = note.Note("F-")
            >>> n1.offset = 20.0
            >>> stream1 = Stream()
            >>> stream1.append(n1)
            >>> n1.getOffsetBySite(stream1)
            0.0 
            >>> n1.offset
            0.0 
            >>> stream2 = Stream()
            >>> stream2.insertAtNativeOffset(n1)
            >>> stream2[0].offset
            20.0 
            >>> n1.getOffsetBySite(stream2)
            20.0 

        .. method:: isClass(className)

            Returns true if the Stream or Stream Subclass is a particular class or subclasses that class. Used by getElementsByClass in Stream 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> a.isClass(note.Note)
            False 
            >>> a.isClass(Stream)
            True 
            >>> b = Measure()
            >>> b.isClass(Measure)
            True 
            >>> b.isClass(Stream)
            True 

        .. method:: isSequence(includeDurationless=True, includeEndBoundary=False)

            A stream is a sequence if it has no overlaps. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> for x in [0,0,0,0,3,3,3]:
            ...     n = note.Note('G#') 
            ...     n.duration = duration.Duration('whole') 
            ...     n.offset = x * 1 
            ...     a.insert(n) 
            ... 
            >>> a.isSequence()
            False 

        .. method:: makeAccidentals(pitchPast=None, useKeySignature=True, alteredPitches=None, cautionaryPitchClass=True, cautionaryAll=False, inPlace=True, overrideStatus=False, cautionaryNotImmediateRepeat=True)

            A method to set and provide accidentals given varous conditions and contexts. If `useKeySignature` is True, a :class:`~music21.key.KeySignature` will be searched for in this Stream or this Stream's defined contexts. An alternative KeySignature can be supplied with this object and used for temporary pitch processing. If `alteredPitches` is a list of modified pitches (Pitches with Accidentals) that can be directly supplied to Accidental processing. These are the same values obtained from a :class:`music21.key.KeySignature` object using the :attr:`~music21.key.KeySignature.alteredPitches` property. If `cautionaryPitchClass` is True, comparisons to past accidentals are made regardless of register. That is, if a past sharp is found two octaves above a present natural, a natural sign is still displayed. If `cautionaryAll` is True, all accidentals are shown. If `overrideStatus` is True, this method will ignore any current `displayStatus` stetting found on the Accidental. By default this does not happen. If `displayStatus` is set to None, the Accidental's `displayStatus` is set. If `cautionaryNotImmediateRepeat` is True, cautionary accidentals will be displayed for an altered pitch even if that pitch had already been displayed as altered. The :meth:`~music21.pitch.Pitch.updateAccidentalDisplay` method is used to determine if an accidental is necessary. This will assume that the complete Stream is the context of evaluation. For smaller context ranges, call this on Measure objects. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            

        .. method:: makeBeams(inPlace=True)

            Return a new measure with beams applied to all notes. In the process of making Beams, this method also updates tuplet types. This is destructive and thus changes an attribute of Durations in Notes. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            >>> aMeasure = Measure()
            >>> aMeasure.timeSignature = meter.TimeSignature('4/4')
            >>> aNote = note.Note()
            >>> aNote.quarterLength = .25
            >>> aMeasure.repeatAppend(aNote,16)
            >>> bMeasure = aMeasure.makeBeams()

        .. method:: makeMeasures(meterStream=None, refStreamOrTimeRange=None, inPlace=False)

            Take a stream and partition all elements into measures based on one or more TimeSignature defined within the stream. If no TimeSignatures are defined, a default is used. This always creates a new stream with Measures, though objects are not copied from self stream. If `meterStream` is provided, this is used to establish a sequence of :class:`~music21.meter.TimeSignature` objects, instead of any found in the Stream. If `refStreamOrTimeRange` is provided, this is used to provide minimum and maximum offset values, necessary to fill empty rests and similar. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            >>> sSrc = Stream()
            >>> sSrc.repeatAppend(note.Rest(), 3)
            >>> sMeasures = sSrc.makeMeasures()
            >>> len(sMeasures.measures)
            1 
            >>> sMeasures[0].timeSignature
            <music21.meter.TimeSignature 4/4> 
            >>> sSrc.insert(0.0, meter.TimeSignature('3/4'))
            >>> sMeasures = sSrc.makeMeasures()
            >>> sMeasures[0].timeSignature
            <music21.meter.TimeSignature 3/4> 
            >>> sSrc = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> sSrc.repeatAppend(n, 10)
            >>> sSrc.repeatInsert(n, [x+.5 for x in range(10)])
            >>> sMeasures = sSrc.makeMeasures()
            >>> len(sMeasures.measures)
            3 
            >>> sMeasures[0].timeSignature
            <music21.meter.TimeSignature 4/4> 

        .. method:: makeRests(refStreamOrTimeRange=None, inPlace=True)

            Given a Stream with an offset not equal to zero, fill with one Rest preeceding this offset. If `refStreamOrTimeRange` is provided as a Stream, this Stream is used to get min and max offsets. If a list is provided, the list assumed to provide minimum and maximum offsets. Rests will be added to fill all time defined within refStream. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> a.insert(20, note.Note())
            >>> len(a)
            1 
            >>> a.lowestOffset
            20.0 
            >>> b = a.makeRests()
            >>> len(b)
            2 
            >>> b.lowestOffset
            0.0 

        .. method:: makeTies(meterStream=None, inPlace=True, displayTiedAccidentals=False)

            Given a stream containing measures, examine each element in the stream if the elements duration extends beyond the measures bound, create a tied  entity. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            >>> d = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> n.quarterLength = 12
            >>> d.repeatAppend(n, 10)
            >>> d.repeatInsert(n, [x+.5 for x in range(10)])
            >>> x = d.makeMeasures()
            >>> x = x.makeTies()

        .. method:: measureOffsetMap(classFilterList=None)

            If this Stream contains Measures, provide a dictionary where keys are offsets and values are a list of references to one or more Measures that start at that offset. The offset values is always in the frame of the calling Stream (self). The `classFilterList` argument can be a list of classes used to find Measures. A default of None uses Measure. 

            >>> from music21 import corpus
            >>> a = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv324.xml')
            >>> sorted(a[0].measureOffsetMap().keys())
            [0.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 34.0, 38.0] 

        .. method:: melodicIntervals(*skipArgs, **skipKeywords)

            Returns a Stream of :class:`~music21.interval.Interval` objects between Notes (and by default, Chords) that follow each other in a stream. the offset of the Interval is the offset of the beginning of the interval (if two notes are adjacent, then it is equal to the offset of the second note) See Stream.findConsecutiveNotes for a discussion of what consecutive notes mean, and which keywords are allowed. The interval between a Note and a Chord (or between two chords) is the interval between pitches[0]. For more complex interval calculations, run findConsecutiveNotes and then use notesToInterval. Returns None of there are not at least two elements found by findConsecutiveNotes. See Test.testMelodicIntervals() for usage details. 

        .. method:: pitchAttributeCount(pitchAttr=name)

            Return a dictionary of pitch class usage (count) by selecting an attribute of the Pitch object. 

            >>> from music21 import corpus
            >>> a = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv324.xml')
            >>> a.pitchAttributeCount('pitchClass')
            {0: 3, 2: 25, 3: 3, 4: 14, 6: 15, 7: 13, 9: 17, 11: 14} 
            >>> a.pitchAttributeCount('name')
            {u'A': 17, u'C': 3, u'B': 14, u'E': 14, u'D': 25, u'G': 13, u'D#': 3, u'F#': 15} 
            >>> a.pitchAttributeCount('nameWithOctave')
            {u'E3': 4, u'G4': 2, u'F#4': 2, u'A2': 2, u'E2': 1, u'G2': 1, u'D3': 9, u'D#3': 1, u'B4': 7, u'A3': 5, u'F#3': 13, u'A4': 10, u'B2': 3, u'B3': 4, u'C3': 2, u'E4': 9, u'D4': 14, u'D5': 2, u'D#4': 2, u'C5': 1, u'G3': 10} 

        .. method:: playingWhenAttacked(el, elStream=None)

            Given an element (from another Stream) returns the single element in this Stream that is sounding while the given element starts. If there are multiple elements sounding at the moment it is attacked, the method returns the first element of the same class as this element, if any. If no element is of the same class, then the first element encountered is returned. For more complex usages, use allPlayingWhileSounding. Returns None if no elements fit the bill. The optional elStream is the stream in which el is found. If provided, el's offset in that Stream is used.  Otherwise, the current offset in el is used.  It is just in case you are paranoid that el.offset might not be what you want. 

            >>> n1 = note.Note("G#")
            >>> n2 = note.Note("D#")
            >>> s1 = Stream()
            >>> s1.insert(20.0, n1)
            >>> s1.insert(21.0, n2)
            >>> n3 = note.Note("C#")
            >>> s2 = Stream()

        .. method:: plot(*args, **keywords)

            Given a method and keyword configuration arguments, create and display a plot. Note: plots requires matplotib to be installed. Plot method can be specified as a second argument or by the `method` keyword. Available plots include the following: pitchSpace (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotHistogramPitchSpace`) pitchClass (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotHistogramPitchClass`) quarterLength (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotHistogramQuarterLength`) scatterPitchSpaceQuarterLength (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterPitchSpaceQuarterLength`) scatterPitchClassQuarterLength (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterPitchClassQuarterLength`) scatterPitchClassOffset (':class:`~graph.PlotScatterPitchClassOffset`) pitchClassOffset (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotHorizontalBarPitchSpaceOffset`) pitchSpaceOffset (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotHorizontalBarPitchClassOffset`) pitchSpaceQuarterLengthCount (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterWeightedPitchSpaceQuarterLength`) pitchClassQuarterLengthCount (:class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterWeigthedPitchClassQuarterLength`) 3DPitchSpaceQuarterLengthCount (:class:`~music21.graph.Plot3DBarsPitchSpaceQuarterLength`) 

            >>> a = Stream()

        .. method:: pop(index)

            Return and remove the object found at the user-specified index value. Index values are those found in `elements` and are not necessary offset order. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> a.repeatInsert(note.Note("C"), range(10))
            >>> junk = a.pop(0)

            9 

        .. method:: prepareNotation(meterStream=None, refStreamOrTimeRange=None, inPlace=False)

            This method calls a sequence of Stream methods on this Stream to prepare notation, including creating Measures if necessary, creating ties, beams, and accidentals. If `inPlace` is True, this is done in-place; if `inPlace` is False, this returns a modified deep copy. 

            >>> from music21 import stream, note
            >>> s = stream.Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note('g')
            >>> n.quarterLength = 1.5
            >>> s.repeatAppend(n, 10)
            >>> sMeasures = s.prepareNotation()
            >>> len(sMeasures.measures)
            4 

        .. method:: remove(target, firstMatchOnly=True)

            Remove an object from this Stream. Additionally, this Stream is removed from the object's sites in :class:`~music21.base.DefinedContexts`. By default, only the first match is removed. This can be adjusted with the `firstMatchOnly` parameters. 

            >>> s = Stream()
            >>> n1 = note.Note('g')
            >>> n2 = note.Note('g#')
            >>> s.insert(10, n1)
            >>> s.insert(5, n2)
            >>> s.remove(n1)
            >>> len(s)
            1 

        .. method:: repeatAppend(item, numberOfTimes)

            Given an object and a number, run append that many times on a deepcopy of the object. numberOfTimes should of course be a positive integer. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> n.duration.type = "whole"
            >>> a.repeatAppend(n, 10)
            >>> a.duration.quarterLength
            40.0 
            >>> a[9].offset
            36.0 

        .. method:: repeatInsert(item, offsets)

            Given an object, create many DEEPcopies at the positions specified by the offset list: 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note('G-')
            >>> n.quarterLength = 1
            >>> a.repeatInsert(n, [0, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
            >>> len(a)
            13 
            >>> a[10].offset
            10.0 

        .. method:: replace(target, replacement, firstMatchOnly=False, allTargetSites=True)

            Given a `target` object, replace all references of that object with references to the supplied `replacement` object. If `allTargetSites` is True, all sites that have a reference for the relacement will be similarly changed. This is useful altering both a flat and nested representation. 

        .. method:: scaleDurations(scalar, inPlace=True)

            Scale all durations by a provided scalar. 

        .. method:: scaleOffsets(scalar, anchorZero=lowest, anchorZeroRecurse=None, inPlace=True)

            Scale all offsets by a provided scalar. The `anchorZero` parameter determines if and/or where the zero offset is established for the set of offsets in this Stream before processing. Offsets are shifted to make either the lower or upper values the new zero; then offsets are scaled; then the shifts are removed. Accepted values are None (no offset shifting), "lowest", or "highest". The `anchorZeroRecurse` parameter determines the anchorZero for all embedded Streams, and Streams embedded within those Streams. If the lowest offset in an embedded Stream is non-zero, setting this value to None will a the space between the start of that Stream and the first element to be scaled. If the lowest offset in an embedded Stream is non-zero, setting this value to 'lowest' will not alter the space between the start of that Stream and the first element to be scaled. To shift all the elements in a Stream, see the :meth:`~music21.stream.Stream.shiftElements` method. 

            >>> from music21 import note
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> n.quarterLength = 2

            20.0 

        .. method:: simultaneousAttacks(stream2)

            returns an ordered list of offsets where elements are started (attacked) in both stream1 and stream2.

        .. method:: splitByClass(objName, fx)

            Given a stream, get all objects specified by objName and then form two new streams.  Fx should be a lambda or other function on elements. All elements where fx returns True go in the first stream. All other elements are put in the second stream. 

            >>> stream1 = Stream()
            >>> for x in range(30,81):
            ...     n = note.Note() 
            ...     n.offset = x 
            ...     n.midi = x 
            ...     stream1.insert(n) 
            >>> fx = lambda n: n.midi > 60
            >>> b, c = stream1.splitByClass(note.Note, fx)
            >>> len(b)

            >>> len(c)
            31 

        .. method:: stripTies(inPlace=False, matchByPitch=False)

            Find all notes that are tied; remove all tied notes, then make the first of the tied notes have a duration equal to that of all tied constituents. Lastly, remove the formerly-tied notes. Presently, this only returns Note objects; Measures and other structures are stripped from the Stream. Presently, this only works if tied notes are sequentual; ultimately this will need to look at .to and .from attributes (if they exist) In some cases (under makeMeasures()) a continuation note will not have a Tie object with a stop attribute set. In that case, we need to look for sequential notes with matching pitches. The matchByPitch option can be used to use this technique. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> n.quarterLength = 6
            >>> a.append(n)
            >>> m = a.makeMeasures()
            >>> m = m.makeTies()
            >>> len(m.flat.notes)
            2 
            >>> m = m.stripTies()
            >>> len(m.flat.notes)
            1 
            >>>

        .. method:: teardownPickleScaffold()

            After rebuilding this stream from pickled storage, prepare this as a normal Stream. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> n = note.Note()
            >>> n.duration.type = "whole"
            >>> a.repeatAppend(n, 10)
            >>> a.setupPickleScaffold()
            >>> a.teardownPickleScaffold()

        .. method:: transferOffsetToElements()

            Transfer the offset of this stream to all internal elements; then set the offset of this stream to zero. 

            >>> a = Stream()
            >>> a.repeatInsert(note.Note("C"), range(0,10))
            >>> a.offset = 30
            >>> a.transferOffsetToElements()
            >>> a.lowestOffset
            30.0 
            >>> a.offset
            0.0 
            >>> a.offset = 20
            >>> a.transferOffsetToElements()
            >>> a.lowestOffset
            50.0 

        .. method:: transpose(value, inPlace=False)

            Transpose all Pitches, Notes, and Chords in the Stream by the user-provided value. If the value is an integer, the transposition is treated in half steps. If the value is a string, any Interval string specification can be provided. returns a new Stream by default, but if the optional "inPlace" key is set to True then it modifies pitches in place. 

            >>> aInterval = interval.Interval('d5')
            >>> from music21 import corpus
            >>> aStream = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv324.xml')
            >>> part = aStream[0]
            >>> aStream[0].pitches[:10]
            [B4, D5, B4, B4, B4, B4, C5, B4, A4, A4] 
            >>> bStream = aStream[0].flat.transpose('d5')
            >>> bStream.pitches[:10]
            [F5, A-5, F5, F5, F5, F5, G-5, F5, E-5, E-5]

            [B5, D6, B5, B5, B5, B5, C6, B5, A5, A5] 
            >>> cStream.flat.transpose(aInterval, inPlace=True)
            >>> cStream.pitches[:10]
            [F6, A-6, F6, F6, F6, F6, G-6, F6, E-6, E-6] 

        .. method:: trimPlayingWhileSounding(el, elStream=None, requireClass=False, padStream=False)

            Returns a Stream of deepcopies of elements in otherStream that sound at the same time as`el. but with any element that was sounding when el. begins trimmed to begin with el. and any element sounding when el ends trimmed to end with el. if padStream is set to true then empty space at the beginning and end is filled with a generic Music21Object, so that no matter what otherStream is the same length as el. Otherwise is the same as allPlayingWhileSounding -- but because these elements are deepcopies, the difference might bite you if you're not careful. Note that you can make el an empty stream of offset X and duration Y to extract exactly that much information from otherStream.

---------

.. class:: Performer(givenElements=None)

    A Stream subclass for designating music to be performed by a single Performer.  Should only be used when a single performer performs on multiple parts.  E.g. Bass Drum and Triangle on separate staves performed by one player. a Part + changes of Instrument is fine for designating most cases where a player changes instrument in a piece.  A part plus staves with individual instrument changes could also be a way of designating music that is performed by a single performer (see, for instance the Piano doubling Celesta part in Lukas Foss's Time Cycle).  The Performer Stream-subclass could be useful for analyses of, for instance, how 5 percussionists chose to play a piece originally designated for 4 (or 6) percussionists in the score.

Score
-----

.. class:: Score(*args, **keywords)

    A Stream subclass for handling multi-part music. Absolutely optional (the largest containing Stream in a piece could be a generic Stream, or a Part, or a Staff).  And Scores can be embedded in other Scores (in fact, our original thought was to call this class a Fragment because of this possibility of continuous embedding), but we figure that many people will like calling the largest container a Score and that this will become a standard.

.. module:: music21.analysis.correlate

Various tools and utilities to find correlations between disparate objects in a Stream. See the chapter :ref:`overviewFormats` for more information and examples of converting formats into and out of music21. 


ActivityMatch
-------------

.. inheritance-diagram:: ActivityMatch

.. class:: ActivityMatch(streamObj)

    Given a Stream, find if one object is active while another is also active. Plotting routines to graph the output of dedicated methods in this class are available. :class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterPitchSpaceDynamicSymbol` and :class:`~music21.graph.PlotScatterWeightedPitchSpaceDynamicSymbol` employs the :meth:`~music21.analysis.correlate.ActivityMatch.pitchToDynamic` method. Sample output is as follows: 

    .. image:: images/PlotScatterWeightedPitchSpaceDynamicSymbol.* 
        :width: 600

    

    

    **ActivityMatch** **methods**

        .. method:: pitchToDynamic(dataPoints=True)

            Create an analysis of pitch to dynamic symbol. If `dataPoints` is True, all data matches between source and destination are returned. If false, 3 point weighted coordinates are created for each unique match. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> s = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv8.6.xml')
            >>> am = analysis.correlate.ActivityMatch(s[0].flat.sorted)
            >>> am.pitchToDynamic()
            Traceback (most recent call last): 
            CorrelateException: cannot create correlation an object that is not found in the Stream: <class 'music21.dynamics.Dynamic'> 
            >>> s = corpus.parseWork('schumann/opus41no1', 2)
            >>> am = analysis.correlate.ActivityMatch(s[0].flat.sorted)
            >>> data = am.pitchToDynamic()
            >>> len(data)

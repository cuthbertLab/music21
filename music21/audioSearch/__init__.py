    The second is the pitches of the scale.

    A threshold value is the fractional part of the log-base-2 value of the
    frequency.

    For instance if A = 440 and B-flat = 460, then the threshold between
    A and B-flat will be 450.  Notes below 450 should be considered As and those
    above 450 should be considered B-flats.

    Thus, the list returned has one less element than the number of notes in the
    scale + octave repetition.  If useScale is a ChromaticScale, `prepareThresholds`
    will return a 12 element list.  If it's a diatonic scale, it'll have 7 elements.

    Note that `smoothLevels=1` is the baseline that does nothing:

    >>> audioSearch.smoothFrequencies(inputPitches, smoothLevels=1) == inputPitches
    True

    And less than 1 raises a ValueError:

    >>> audioSearch.smoothFrequencies(inputPitches, smoothLevels=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: smoothLevels must be >= 1

    There cannot be more smoothLevels than input frequencies:

    >>> audioSearch.smoothFrequencies(inputPitches, smoothLevels=40)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: There cannot be more smoothLevels (40) than inputPitches (32)

    Note that the system runs on O(smoothLevels * len(frequenciesList)),
    so additional smoothLevels can be costly on a large set.

    This function always returns a list of ints -- rounding to the nearest
    hertz (you did want it smoothed right?)

    * Changed in v6: inPlace defaults to False (like other music21
      functions) and if done in Place, returns nothing.  smoothLevels and inPlace
      became keyword only.

        result.derivation.method = function.__name__
        return result
    return wrapper


class Derivation(SlottedObject):
    '''
    A Derivation object keeps track of which Streams (or perhaps other Music21Objects)
    a Stream has come from and how.

    >>> s1 = stream.Stream()
    >>> s1.id = "DerivedStream"
    >>> d1 = derivation.Derivation(s1)

    >>> s2 = stream.Stream()
    >>> s2.id = "OriginalStream"
        
    >>> d1.method = 'manual'
    >>> d1.origin = s2
    >>> d1
    <Derivation of <music21.stream.Stream DerivedStream> from <music21.stream.Stream OriginalStream> via "manual">
    >>> d1.origin is s2
    True

    >>> d1.client is s1
    True

    >>> import copy
    >>> d2 = copy.deepcopy(d1)
    >>> d2.origin is s2
    True

    >>> d1.method = 'measure'
    >>> d1.method
    'measure'
        
    Deleting the origin stream does not change the Derivation, since origin is held by strong ref:
    
    >>> import gc  # Garbage collection...
    >>> del(s2)
    >>> unused = gc.collect()  # ensure Garbage collection is run
    >>> d1
    <Derivation of <music21.stream.Stream DerivedStream> from <music21.stream.Stream OriginalStream> via "measure">

    But deleting the client stream changes the Derivation, since client is held by weak ref:

    >>> del(s1)
    >>> unused = gc.collect()  # ensure Garbage collection is run
    >>> d1
    <Derivation of None from <music21.stream.Stream OriginalStream> via "measure">

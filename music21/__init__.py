    Music21 v.5 is a Python {}+ only library.
    Use music21 v.4 to run on Python 2.7.

    If you got this library by installing there are several options.

    - 1. (Best) Upgrade to Python 3, latest.

         The great features there will more
         than make up for the headache of downloading
         a new version from https://www.python.org/

         You may already have Python 3 on your system.
         Try running "python3" instead of "python"

    - 2. Upgrade pip and setuptools to the latest version
         and then "upgrade" music21 to version 4.

         $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
         $ pip install 'music21<5.0'
